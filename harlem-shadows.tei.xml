		  These three poems, appearing in the "Current Poetry" section of <title level="j">The Literary Digest</title>, are
		  introduced with the following note:
		  <quote>
		    Since Dunbar, no Negro singer has interpreted Negro sentiment and emotion with a poetic realism to equal Claude McKay's. Of purest African blood, he shows us in "Harlem Shadows" not only the America of his youth and the Jamaica of his childhood, but the Africa of his forbearsâ€”and how he feels toward each. There is a world of relevation in these.

	    <p>These poems have a special interest for all the 
	    races of man because they are sung by a pure 
	    blooded Negro. They are the first significant 
	    expression of that race in poetry. We tried 
	    faithfully to give a position in our literature to 
	    Paul Laurence Dunbar. We have excessively 
	    welcomed other black poets of minor talent, seeking 
	    in their music some distinctive quality other 
	    than the fact that they wrote it. But here for 
	    the first time we find our literature vividly enriched
	    by a voice from this most alien race 
	    among us. And it should be illuminating to 
	    observe that while these poems are characteristic 
	    of that race as we most admire itâ€”they are 
	    gentle-simple, candid, brave and friendly, quick 
	    of laughter and of tearsâ€”yet they are still more 
	    characteristic of what is deep and universal in 
	    mankind. There is no special or exotic kind of 
	    merit in them, no quality that demands a transmutation 
	    of our own natures to perceive. Just 
	    as the sculptures and wood and ivory carvings of

	    are tranquil in the possession of the qualities of 
	    all classic and great art, so these poems, the 
	    purest of them, move with a sovereignty that is 
	    never new to the lovers of the high music of 
	    human utterance.</p>

	    <p>It is the peculiarity of his experience, rather 
	    than of his nature, that makes this poet's race a 
	    fact to be remembered in the enjoyment of his 
	    songs. The subject of all poetry is the experience 
	    of the poet, and no man of any other race in the 
	    world can touch or imagine the experience of the 
	    children of African slaves in America.</p>

	    <p>Claude McKay was born in 1890 in a little 
	    thatched house of two rooms in a beautiful valley 
	    of the hilly middle-country of Jamaica. He 
	    was born to the genial, warm, patient, neighborly 
	    farmer's life of that island. It was a life 
	    rich in sun and sound and color and emotion, as 
	    we can see in his poems which are forever 
	    homeward yearningâ€”in the midst of their present 
	    passion and strong will into the future, forever 
	    vividly remembering. Like a blue-bird's note in 
	    a March wind, those sudden clear thoughts of 

	    <pb n="xi"/>

	    the warm South ring out in the midst of his northern 
	    songs. They carry a thrill into the depth 
	    of our hearts. Perhaps in some sense they are 
	    thoughts of a mother. At least it seems inevitable 
	    that we should find among them those 
	    two sacred sonnets of a child's bereavement. It 
	    seems inevitable that a wonderful poet should 
	    have had a wise and beautiful mother.</p>

	    <p>We can only distantly imagine how the happy 
	    tropic life of play and affection, became shadowed 
	    and somber for this sensitive boy as he grew, 
	    by a sense of the subjection of his people, 
	    and the memory of their bondage to an alien 
	    race. Indeed the memory of Claude McKay's 
	    family goes back on his mother's side beyond 
	    the days of bondage, to a time in Madagascar 
	    when they were still free, and by the grace of 
	    God still "savage." He learned in early childhood 
	    the story of their violent abduction, and 
	    how they were freighted over the seas in ships, 
	    and sold at public auction in Jamaica. He learned 
	    another story, too, which must have kindled a 
	    fire that slept in his bloodâ€”a story of the rebellion 
	    of the members of his own family at the 
	    auction-block. A death-strike, we should call it 


	    <pb n="xii" />

	    nowâ€”for they agreed that if they were divided 
	    and sold away into different parts of the country 
	    they would all kill themselves. And this fact 
	    solemnly announced in the market by the oldest 
	    white-haired Negro among them, had such an 
	    effect upon prospective buyers that it was impossible 
	    to sell them as individuals, and so they were 
	    all taken away together to those hills at Clarendon 
	    which their descendants still cultivate. With the 
	    blood of these rebels in his veins, and their memory 
	    to stir it, we cannot wonder that Claude 
	    McKay's earliest boyish songs in the Jamaica dialect 
	    were full of heresy and the militant love of 
	    freedom, and that his first poem of political significance 
	    should have been a rally-call to the 
	    street-car men on strike in Kingston. He found 
	    himself by an instinctive gravitation singing in 
	    the forefront of the battle for human liberty. A 
	    wider experience and a man's comprehension of 
	    the science of history has only strengthened his 
	    voice and his resolution.</p>

	    <p>Those early songs and the music he composed 
	    for them, were very popular in Jamaica. Claude 
	    McKay was quite the literary prince of the island 
	    for a timeâ€”a kind of Robert Burns among his 

	    <pb n="xiii"/>

	    own people, as we can imagine, with his physical 
	    beauty, his quick sympathy, and the magnetic 
	    wayward humor of his ways. He received in 
	    1912 the medal of the Institute of Arts and 
	    Sciences in recognition of his preÃ«minence. He 
	    was the first Negro to receive this medal, and 
	    he was the first poet who ever made songs in the 
	    quaint haunting dialect of the island. But nevertheless 
	    it was not until he came to the United 
	    States that Claude McKay began to confront 
	    the deepest feelings in his heart, and realize that 
	    a delicate syllabic music could not alone express 
	    them. Here his imagination awoke, and the 
	    colored imagery that is the language of all deep 
	    passion began to appear in his poetry. Here 
	    too he conceived and felt the history and position 
	    of his people with mature poetic force. He knew 
	    that his voice belonged not only to his own moods 
	    and the general experience of humanity, but to 
	    the hopes and sorrows of his race.</p>

	    <p>A great many foolish things are said even by 
	    wise people upon the subject of racial inferiority. 
	    They seem to think that if science could 
	    establish a certain difference of average ity 
	    as between the whites and blacks, that would 

	    <pb n="xiv"/> 

	    justify them in placing the whole of one of these 
	    races in a position of inferior esteem. The same 
	    fallacy is committed in the discussions of sex-inferiority, 
	    and it is worth while to make clear 
	    the perfect folly of it. If any defined quantitative 
	    difference is ever established between the 
	    average abilities of such groups, it will be a 
	    relatively slight one. The difficulty of establishing 
	    it, is a proof of that. And a slight difference 
	    in the general average would have no application 
	    whatever as between any two individuals, or any 
	    minor groups of individuals. The enormous majority 
	    of both races, as of both sexes, would show 
	    the same degree of ability. And so great is the 
	    factor of individual variation that we could not 
	    even be sure an example of the highest ability 
	    might not arise in the group whose average was 
	    "inferior." This simple consideration of fact and 
	    good logic should suffice to silence those who 
	    think they can ever appeal to science in support 
	    of a general race or sex prejudice.</p>

	    <p>But in so far as the problem arises between a 
	    dominant and a subjected race, it is impossible 
	    for science to say anything even as to averages. 
	    For a fair general test is impossible. The children 


	    <pb n="xv" />

	    of the subjected race never have a chance. 
	    To be deprived at the very dawn of selfhood of 
	    a sense of possible superiority, is to be undernourished 
	    at the point of chief educative importance. 
	    And to be assailed in early childhood with 
	    a pervading intimation of inferiority is poison in 
	    the very centers of growth. Except for people of 
	    the highest force of character, therefore, to be 
	    born into a subjected race is to grow up inferior, 
	    not only to the other race, but to one's own potential 
	    self. We see an example of this kind of 
	    growth in the bombastic locutions of the traditional 
	    "darkie" who has acquired a little culture. 
	    Those great big words and long sentences are the 
	    result of a feeling of inferiority. They are a 
	    pathetic over-correction of the very quality of 
	    simple-heartedness which is carried so high in 
	    these poems of Claude McKay. It is carried so 
	    high, and made so boldly beautiful, that we can 
	    not withhold a tribute to his will, as well as to 
	    his music and imagination. The naked force of 
	    character that we feel in those two recent sonnets, 
	    "Baptism" and "The White City," is no 
	    mere verbal semblance. Its reality is certified by 
	    the very achievement of such commanding art

	    <pb n="xvi" /> 

	    in the face of a contemptuous or condescending 
	    civilization.</p>

	    <p>Claude McKay came to the United States in 
	    1912, having been offered an education here by 
	    a friend in Jamaica who believed in his abilities. 
	    His intention was to learn scientific farming, and 
	    return to the island to offer practical wisdom as 
	    well as music to his people. He went at first to 
	    one of our established philanthropic institutions 
	    for the training of colored people. He stayed 
	    there a few monthsâ€”long enough to weary of 
	    the almost military system of discipline. And 
	    then he went to the Agricultural College of 
	    Kansas, where he had learned that a free life 
	    and a more elective system of education prevailed. 
	    He studied for two years there, thinking continually 
	    less about farming and more about literature, 
	    and gradually losing away altogether the 
	    idea of returning to live in Jamaica. He left the 
	    college in 1914, knowing that he was a poetâ€”and 
	    imagining, I think, that he was a rather irresponsible 
	    and wayward characterâ€”to cast in his lot 
	    with the working-class Negroes of the north. 
	    Since then he has earned his living in every 
	    one of the ways that the northern Negroes do, 

	    <pb n="xvii"/>

	    from "pot-wrestling" in a boarding-house kitchen 
	    to dining-car service on the New York and Philadelphia 
	    Express. But like all true poets, he failed 
	    to take the duty of "earning a living" very seriously. 
	    It was a matter of collecting enough money 
	    from each new job to quit for a while and live. 
	    And with each period of living a new and a more 
	    sure and beautiful song would come out of him.</p>

	    <p>The growth of beauty and sureness in these 
	    songs would be apparent if they were arranged 
	    in the order of their creation. As it is, the 
	    reader will observe occasional lapses of quality. 
	    One or two of the rhythms I confess I am not 
	    able to apprehend at all. Perhaps they will be 
	    picked up by receivers who are attuned to a different 
	    wave-length. But the quality is here in 
	    them allâ€”the pure, clear arrow-like transference 
	    of his emotion into our breast, without any but 
	    the inevitable wordsâ€”the quality that reminds us 
	    of Burns and Villon and Catullus, and all the 
	    poets that we call lyric because we love them so 
	    much. It is the quality that Keats sought to 
	    cherish when he said that "Poetry should be 
	    great and unobtrusive, a thing which enters into 
	    the soul, and does not startle or amaze with 


	    <pb n="xviii"/> 

	    itself but with its subject." Poetry with this 
	    quality is not for those whose interest is mainly 
	    in the manufacture of poems. It will come rather 
	    to those whose interest is in the life of things. 
	    It is the poetry of life, and not of the poet's 
	    chamber. It is the poetry that looks upon a 
	    thing, and sings. It is possessed by a feeling and 
	    sings. May it find its way a little quietly and 
	    softly, in this age of roar and advertising, to the 
	    hearts that love a true and unaffected song.</p>

	    <p>In putting ideas and feelings into poetry, I have 
	    tried in each case to use the medium most 
	    adaptable to the specific purpose. I own allegiance 
	    to no master. I have never found it possible 
	    to accept in entirety any one poet. But I 
	    have loved and joyed in what I consider the finest 
	    in the poets of all ages.</p>

	    <p>The speech of my childhood and early youth 
	    was the Jamaica Negro dialect, the native variant 
	    of English, which still preserves a few words of 
	    African origin, and which is more difficult of 
	    understanding than the American Negro dialect. 
	    But the language we wrote and read in school 
	    was England's English. Our text books then, 
	    before the advent of the American and Jamaican 
	    readers and our teachers, too, were all English-made. 
	    The native teachers of the elementary 
	    schools were tutored by men and women of British 
	    import. I quite remember making up verses in 
	    the dialect and in English for our moonlight ring 

	    <pb n="xx" />

	    dances and for our school parties. Of our purely 
	    native songs the jammas (field and road), shay-shays 
	    (yard and booth), wakes (post-mortem), 
	    Anancy tales (transplanted African folk lore), 
	    and revivals (religious) are all singularly punctuated 
	    by meter and rhyme. And nearly all my 
	    own poetic thought has always run naturally into 
	    these regular forms.</p>

	    <p>Consequently, although very conscious of the 
	    new criticisms and trends in poetry, to which I 
	    am keenly responsive and receptive, I have adhered 
	    to such of the older traditions as I find 
	    adequate for my most lawless and revolutionary 
	    passions and moods. I have not used patterns, 
	    images and words that would stamp me a 
	    classicist nor a modernist. My intellect is not 
	    scientific enough to range me on the side of 
	    either; nor is my knowledge wide enough for me 
	    to specialize in any school.</p>

	    <p>I have never studied poetics; but the forms 
	    I have used I am convinced are the ones I can 
	    work in with the highest degree of spontaneity 
	    and freedom.</p>

	    <p>I have chosen my melodies and rhythms by 
	    instinct, and I have favored words and figures

	    <pb n="xxi" />

	    which flow smoothly and harmoniously into my 
	    compositions. And in all my moods I have 
	    striven to achieve directness, truthfulness and 
	    naturalness of expression instead of an enameled 
	    originality. I have not hesitated to use words 
	    which are old, and in some circles considered 
	    poetically overworked and dead, when I thought 
	    I could make them glow alive by new manipulation. 
	    Nor have I stinted my senses of the pleasure 
	    of using the decorative metaphor where it is 
	    more truly and vividly beautiful than the exact 
	    phrase. But for me there is more quiet delight 
	    in "The golden moon of heaven" than in "The 
	    terra-cotta disc of cloud-land."</p>

	    <p>Finally, while I have welcomed criticism, 
	    friendly and unfriendly, and listened with willing 
	    attention to many varying opinions concerning 
	    other poems and my own, I have always, in the 
	    summing up, fallen back on my own ear and 
	    taste as the arbiter.</p>

So far as I can learn, the term was first used to designate a part of the country which was distinguished by the colour of the soil. THe part of the country possessing this thick, dark, and naturally rich soil was, of course, the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable, and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers. Later, and especially since the war [the American Civil War], the term seems to be used wholly in a political sense---that is, to designate the counties where the balck people outnumber the white."</note>;</l>

	      <l>Not once in all our days of poignant love,</l>

	      <l>The truth which poisoned our illicit wine,</l>
	      <l>That even I was faithless to my race</l>
	      <l>Bleeding beneath the iron hand of thine,</l>
	      <l>Our union seemed a monstrous thing and base!</l>
	      <l>I was an outcast from thy world and mine.</l>

	      <l>New gales of tropic fury round my head</l>
	      <l>Break lashing me through hours of soulful dread;</l>
	      <l>But when the terror thins and, spent, withdraws,</l>
	      <l>Leaving me wondering awhile, I pauseâ€”</l>
	      <l>But soon again the risky ways I tread!</l>
	      <l>No rigid road for me, no peace, no rest,</l>
	      <l>While molten elements run through my blood;</l>
	      <l>And beauty-burning bodies manifest</l>
	      <l>Their warm, heart-melting motions to be wooed;</l>
	      <l>And passion boldly rising in my breast,</l>
	      <l>Like rivers of the Spring, lets loose its flood.</l>

	    <pb n="275" />

	    <p>The present revival of poetry in America 
	    could scarcely advance without 
	    carrying in its wake the impulse and practice 
	    of a poetic consciousness in the Negro race.</p>

	    <p>While we have no traditions in the art, 
	    we have a rich and precious tradition in 
	    the substance of poetry: vision, intense emotionalism, 
	    spiritual and mystical affinities, 
	    with both abstract and concrete experience, 
	    and a subtle natural sense of rhythmic 
	    values. All these are essential folk-qualities, 
	    primal virtues in the expression of 
	    impassioned experience, whether festive of 
	    ceremonial, in all the indigenous folk-literatures 
	    of the world. But when a race 
	    advances from primitive life and customs, 
	    or when the divisions of a particular race 
	    become sharply differentiated by learning 
	    and culture, and intercourse with other 
	    peoples with modes of culture more perfect in 
	    certain respects affects them, there is produced 
	    a standard of form in written and 
	    oral speech that becomes a characteristic 
	    of class co-racial consciousness. This standard 
	    becomes the medium of literary expression 
	    in which taste is the vital essence, 
	    and is opposed by the "vulgar tongue" of 
	    the "people" in which the vigorous and imaginative 
	    folk-ballads are recited, the communal 
	    chants of traditional custom and 
	    ritual dramatized, and national songs sung.</p>

	    <p>The survival of the vulgar tongue in modern 
	    times, where the influence of formal and 
	    conventional civilization has penetrated 
	    among primitive communities, is in dialect 
	    the attempt of the invaded, enslaved, and 
	    suppressed peoples, to imitate phonetically 
	    the speech of the dominant class or race. 
	    Dialect is, thus, not the corruption of the 
	    folk or tribal language, of the Frankish 
	    invaders of Gaul, of the Anglo-Saxon conquest 
	    of ancient Britain, of the absorption 
	    of the African savagesâ€”who be likened 
	    in every tribal respect to the Franks, 
	    Angles and Saxonsâ€”by America, but of 
	    the language of the Latins, the Britons, and 
	    the English.</p>

	    <p>Dialect may be employed as the <foreign rend="italics">langue 
	    d'oc</foreign> of FrÃ©dÃ©ric Mistral's ProvenÃ§al poems, 
	    as a preserved tongue, the only adequate 
	    medium of rendering the psychology of character, 
	    and of describing the background of 
	    the people whose lives and experience are 
	    kept within the environment, where the 
	    dialect survives as the universal speech; or it 
	    may be employed as a special mark of emphasis
	    upon the peculiar characteristic and 
	    temperamental traits of a people whose 
	    action and experiences are given in contact 
	    and relationship with a dominant language, 
	    and are set in a literary fabric of which they 
	    are but one strand of many in the weaving.</p>

	    <p>I have gone to some length in the foregoing 
	    because the matter is of vital importance 
	    to those who regard the future accomplishment 
	    of the Negro in American literature. 
	    It holds, too, I think, the explanation 
	    of that gap which exists between the 
	    mysterious and anonymous period of the 
	    "Sorrow Songs"â€”vivid, intense poetry of 
	    a suffering, but eternally confident folkâ€”and 
	    the advent of Paul Laurence Dunbar. 
	    The Negro poet as such, can be said to 
	    have inherited no poetic traditions which 
	    would make him a bi-national artist: that 
	    is to say, he had no precursors sufficient 
	    in numbers and of decided genius, the 
	    substance of whose song was racial, while the 
	    expression was nationalâ€”the glorious and 
	    perfect instrument of English poetic art, 
	    which we know as the common possession 
	    of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, 
	    Keats, Shelley, Swinburne, Browning, 
	    Longfellow, Poe and Lowell.</p>

	    <p>This gap I postulate as a silent transition 
	    to a new order of imaginative and emotional 
	    racial utterance. Remember that 
	    here was a race of many tribes, members 
	    of which amounting to hundreds of thousands 
	    were stolen from their native homes, 
	    from their immemorial customs and traditions, 
	    which in many instances have been 
	    proven to be the traits of a highly organized 
	    primitive culture and social code, and 
	    forcibly held in a captivity that suppressed 
	    every virtue but work and every 
	    ideal but obedience. The struggle through 
	    two centuries under this unchristian suppression 
	    was toward the acquisition of a 
	    <pb n="276" />
	    new language which in all its unfamiliar 
	    and tortuous meanings had to be learned 
	    through the auditory sense, as the invaluable 
	    aids of reading and writing were denied; 
	    and it is little wonder that the earliest 
	    and latest folk utterance of these 
	    people was the collective yearning of sorrow, 
	    impassioned and symbolic, addressed 
	    to the one benign spirit their masters taught 
	    them from whom to seek love and mercy in 
	    a mystical hereafter as a compensation for 
	    their miserable existence on earth. It was 
	    the poetry of an ancient race passing 
	    through the throes of an enforced re-birth 
	    into the epoch of an alien and dominating 
	    civilization.</p>

	    <p>When it sought voice in Paul Laurence 
	    Dunbar, it did so with old memories and 
	    impulses; it was the finale, in a rather 
	    conscious manner, of centuries of spiritual 
	    isolation, of a detached brooding and yearning 
	    for self-realization in the universal 
	    human scale, and in a childish gayety in 
	    eating the fruits of a freedom so suddenly 
	    possessed and difficult to realize. Dunbar 
	    was the end of a rÃ©gime, and not the beginning 
	    of a tradition, as most careless critics, 
	    both white and colored, seem to think. But 
	    his niche is secure because he made the 
	    effort to express himself, and clothe his 
	    material artistically; though he never ventured 
	    into the abstract intricacies and wrung 
	    from the elements of rhythmic principles 
	    the subtle and most haunting forms of expression. 
	    His work reflected chiefly the life 
	    of the Negro during the era of Reconstruction 
	    and just a little beyond, when the race 
	    was emerging from the illusion of freedom 
	    to the hard and bitter reality of how 
	    much ground still remained to be dishearteningly 
	    but persistently fought for before 
	    a moral and spiritual liberty, as well as 
	    a complete political freedom and social fraternity, 
	    was attained. When Mr. Howells said 
	    that Dunbar was the first poet of his 
	    race to express and interpret the life of 
	    his people lyrically, he told only a half-truth; 
	    what survives and attracts us in 
	    the poetry of Dunbar is the life of the 
	    Negro in the limited experience of a transitional 
	    period, the rather helpless and 
	    still subservient era of testing freedom, and 
	    adjusting in the mass a new condition of 
	    relationship to the social, economic, civil 
	    and spiritual fabric of American civilization. 
	    Behind all this was an awakening 
	    impulse, a burning and brooding aspiration, 
	    creeping like a smothered fire through 
	    the consciousness of the race, which broke occasionally 
	    in Dunbar as through the crevices 
	    of his spiritâ€”notably the sonnet to "Robert 
	    Gould Shaw," the "Ode to Ethiopia," and a 
	    few other poemsâ€”but which he did not 
	    have the deep and indignant and impassioned 
	    vision, or the subtle and enchanting 
	    art to sustain.</p>

	    <p>Such a poet we did have in substance, 
	    though he chose to express himself in the 
	    rhythms of impassioned prose rather than 
	    the more restricted and formal rhythm of 
	    verse. But the fact is as solid as the earth 
	    itself, that Dr. DuBois in "The Souls of 
	    Black Folk" began a poetry tradition. 
	    This book has more profoundly affected the 
	    spiritual nature of the race than any other 
	    ever written in this country; and has more 
	    clearly revealed to the nation at large the 
	    true idealism and high aspiration of the 
	    American Negro; and the intellectual mind 
	    of the country accepted it as the humanistic 
	    doctrine by which on terms of equal economic, 
	    political and social endeavor the 
	    Negro was to work out his destiny as an 
	    American citizenâ€”sharing pound for pound 
	    the weight of responsibility, enjoying the 
	    same indivisible measure of privilege in the 
	    American democracy.</p>

	    <p>It is only through the intense, passionate, 
	    spiritual idealism of such substance as 
	    makes "The Souls of Black Folk" such 
	    a quivering rhapsody of wrongs endured and 
	    hopes to be fulfilled that the poets of the 
	    race with compelling artistry can lift the 
	    Negro into the only full and complete nationalism 
	    he knowsâ€”that of the American 
	    democracy. "There is no difference between 
	    men;" declared G. Lowes Dickinson, the 
	    English Platonist, "wealth, position race or 
	    nationality, make no difference between 
	    men: it is only the growth of the soul." And 
	    the poets of a race give expression and reality 
	    to the soul of a people through whose 
	    eternal laws no unnatural impediments of 
	    injustices or wrongs can keep from <choice><sic>ascendency</sic><corr>ascendancy</corr></choice>
	    to the highest <choice><sic>fulfilment</sic><corr>fulfillment</corr></choice> and the 
	    fullest participation in ideal and eternal 
	    privileges of life.</p>

	    <p>I am not one who believes that a Negro 
	    writer of verseâ€”or of fiction, for that matterâ€”must 
	    think, feel or write racially to 
	    be a great artist; nor can he be distinctively 
	    labeled by the material he uses. This is a 
	    <pb n="277" />
	    fallacy too often expressed by critics to 
	    confirm the desired hypothesis that the 
	    Negro is humanly different in the scale of 
	    mankind, that even after some centuries of 
	    civilizing process in America, he is still 
	    nearer in his most cultivated class to the 
	    instincts of his ancestral forbears than any 
	    other of the conglomerate races who compose 
	    the citizenry of the Republic. In every 
	    race and nation there are primitives who 
	    retain and impulses of barbarism, more evident 
	    and prevalent among peoples of the 
	    Teutonic stock than among those of the 
	    Latin stock. But the Negro has absorbed, 
	    in his advanced class, just as the advanced 
	    class of any other peoples, the culture of 
	    the best civilizations in the world today, and 
	    in his imaginative and artistic expression 
	    he is universal. What I said about embodying 
	    racial aspirations and material does not 
	    alter this fact. All great artists are interracial 
	    and international in rendering in the 
	    medium of any particular art the fundamental 
	    passions and the primary instincts of 
	    humanity.</p>

	    <p>The promise of this I seem to detect in 
	    the spiritual voice of the Negro becoming 
	    articulate in the poets who are beginning 
	    to emerge from the background of the people. 
	    They are springing up around us 
	    everywhere, and it is the profound duty of 
	    the race to encourage and support them. 
	    There is power and beauty in this pristine 
	    utteranceâ€”wood notes wild that have 
	    scarcely yet been heard beyond the forest 
	    of their own dreams. But if we will cherish 
	    these with a responsive audience, one day, 
	    and not very long hence, we shall have a 
	    great chorus of these singers to glorify our 
	    souls and the soul of America.</p>

	    <p>These notes do not include all the poets 
	    who have published books within recent 
	    years; they are intended rather to indicate 
	    tendencies, which I regard as more important 
	    for the moment, and illustrated by the 
	    examples of representative work printed 
	    during the past year. Thus, such writers 
	    as the late James D. Corruthers, Edward 
	    Smyth Jones, George Reginald Margetson, 
	    and others, do not fall within the 
	    scope of this paper. Nor do these writers 
	    quite reach the artistic development of those 
	    I deal with, neither does Mr. Fenton Johnson, 
	    a young man already the author of 
	    three volumes, and whose recent work shows 
	    a rapid and steady progress. This question 
	    of equipment, of a thorough grounding 
	    in the technical elements of the science 
	    of versification, is the greatest handicap to
	    the progress of many contemporary writers 
	    of verse. It is the hard and laborious task 
	    of mastering the subtle and fluctuating 
	    rhythms of verse that the average individual 
	    tries to escape which produces such a mass 
	    of mediocre work, often choking and wasting 
	    the substance of a passionate and imaginative 
	    poetic spirit. It is difficult to impress 
	    upon such individuals that they must 
	    serve a jealous and consecrated apprenticeship 
	    to this divine mistress, and that ambition 
	    is but a humble offering upon the altar 
	    of her sacred mystical religion.</p>

	    <p>There are, however, three books recently 
	    published, which show not only a distinctive 
	    poetic quality, but also an artistic adequacy 
	    of expression and which promise 
	    the <choice><sic>fulfilment</sic><corr>fulfillment</corr></choice> of the Negro in poetry I 
	    have so confidently predicted for the future. 
	    Besides these books, I have in the past year 
	    come across single poems in the magazines 
	    by unknown writers confirming more specifically 
	    the rapid development of the higher 
	    poetic qualities that are manifesting themselves 
	    in the Negro. These latter I will deal 
	    with first, because they represent what I 
	    hope most to see accomplished; because they 
	    are the proofs of the contention that poets 
	    of the race may deal with a rich and original 
	    vein of racial material and give it the highest 
	    forms of creative literary expression, 
	    which neither differentiates the author from 
	    the artist in general nor tolerates for a moment 
	    the false psychology of that gratuitous, 
	    separate standard by which white critics are 
	    prone to judge the works of Negro authors.</p>

	    <p>The most significant accomplishment 
	    among these recent poems are two sonnets 
	    signed by "Eli Edwards" which appeared 
	    in <title level="j" rend="italic">The Seven Arts</title> for last October. "Eli 
	    Edwards," I understand, is the pseudonym 
	    of Claude McKay, who lives in New York 
	    City, choosing to conceal his identity as a 
	    poet from the associates among whom he 
	    works for his daily bread. His story as it 
	    is, which I had from Mr. Oppenheim, who 
	    accepted his poems when editor of <title level="j" rend="italic">The 
	    Seven Arts</title>, if full of alluring interest, and 
	    may one day be vividly featured as a 
	    topic of historic literary importance. For 
	    he may well be the keystone of the new 
	    movement in racial poetic achievement. Let 
	    me quote one of the sonnets:
	    <pb n ="278" />
	    <quote source="#the-harlem-dancer">
	      <lg type="poem">
		<head rend="caps">The Harlem Dancer</head>
		<l>Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes</l>
		<l rend="indent1">And watched her perfect, half-clothed body sway;</l>
		<l>Her voice was like the sound of blended flutes</l>
		<l rend="indent1">Blown by black players upon a picnic day.</l>
		<l>She sang and danced on gracefully and calm,</l>
		<l rend="indent1">The light gauze hanging loose about her form;</l>
		<l>To me she seemed a proudly-swaying palm</l>
		<l rend="indent1">Grown lovelier for passing through a storm.</l>
		<l>Upon her swarthy neck black, shiny curls</l>
		<l rend="indent1">Profusely fell; and, tossing coins in praise,</l>
		<l>The wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys, and even the girls,</l>
		<l rend="indent1">Devoured her with their eager, passionate gaze;</l>
		<l rend="indent1">But, looking at her falsely-smiling face</l>
		<l rend="indent1">I knew her self was not in that strange place.</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>
	    </p>

	    <p>Here, indeed, is the genuine giftâ€”a vision 
	    that evokes from the confusing details of 
	    experience and brings into the picture the 
	    image in all its completeness of outline and 
	    its gradation of color, and rendered with 
	    that precise surety of form possessed by the 
	    resourceful artist. The power in this poet 
	    is, I think, his ability to reproduce a 
	    hectic scene of reality with all the solid 
	    accessories, as in "The Harlem Dancer," 
	    and yet make it float as it were upon a 
	    background of illusion through which comes 
	    piercing the glowing sense of a spiritual 
	    mystery. Note the exalted close of Mr. 
	    <sic>Edward's</sic> riotous picture of the dancer 
	    when

	    <quote>
	      <lg>
		<l>. . . . looking at her falsely-smiling face,</l>
		<l>I knew herself was not in that strange placeâ€”</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>

	    he translates the significance of the intoxicated 
	    figure with its sensuous contagion 
	    into something ultimate behind the 
	    "falsely-smiling face," where "herself"â€”be 
	    it the innocent memory of childhood, perhaps 
	    of some pursuing dream of a brief 
	    happiness in love, or a far-away country 
	    home where her corybantic earnings secures 
	    in peace and comfort for the aged days of 
	    her parentsâ€”is inviolably wrapped in the 
	    innocence and beauty of her dreams. This 
	    sonnet differs in both visionary and artistic 
	    power from anything so far produced by 
	    the poets of the rate. The visual quality 
	    here possessed is extraordinary; not only 
	    does Mr. <sic>Edwards</sic> evoke his images with a 
	    clear and decisive imagination, but he 
	    throws at the same time upon the object 
	    the rich and warm colors his emotional 
	    sympathies.</p>

	    interesting. It is, as the portrait frontispiece and <ref target="#supp_richards_spring-preface">Mr. 
	    Richards' preface</ref> tell us, written by a man who is a full-blooded 
	    negro, and it is, as Mr. Richards says, "the first success in poetry 
	    of a man of an African race with which, in Europe at any rate, 
	    we have been brought into contact." Perhaps the ordinary 
	    reader's first impulse in realizing that the book is by an American 
	    negro is to inquire into its good taste. Not until we are satisfied 
	    that his work does not overstep the barriers which a not 
	    quite explicable but deep instinct in us is ever alive to maintain 
	    can we judge it with genuine fairness. Mr. Claude McKay 
	    never offends our sensibilities. His love poetry clear of the 
	    hint which would put our racial instinct against him whether we 
	    would or no.

	    Here is, indeed, the blot on the scutcheon of the United States.

	    </head>

	    <p>The island of Jamaica has given us three Negroes who, along different lines, have risen 
	    into permanent prominence: Marcus Garvey, president of the Black Star Line and head 
	    of the most widely discussed movement in modern Negrodom; Joel A. Rogers, author 
	    of two books which stand without a peer in the output of Negro writing (<title level="m">From Superman
	    to Man</title> and <title level="m">As Nature Leads</title>); and Claude McKay, whose proud title to distinction 
	    consists of two simple words: The Poet. Mr. McKay began to write poetry before he left 
	    Jamaica, where he published three volumes of verse. Unfortunately (for us) his interest 
	    in his own fame is so slim that he did not take the trouble to preserve any copies of 
	    these earlier volumes, and we are left to speculate as to their quality.</p>

	    <p>Since he came to America Mr. McKay has worked at various jobs, depending firstly
	    on his hands to earn a living for himself. While on one of these jobs he was "discovered" 
	    by <title level="j">Pearson's Magazine</title> and Max Eastman's <title level="j">Liberator</title> of which he is at present associate 
	    editor. He has come to the fore by sheer virtue of the spiritual quality of poetic ability 
	    which no hardships could suppress. Without any aid from Negro editors or publications 
	    he made his way because white people who noted his gifts were eager to give him 
	    a chance while Negro editors, as usual, were either too blind to see or too mean-spirited 
	    to proclaim them to the world. His manly, stirring poem, "If We Must Die," first appeared 
	    in a white publication from which it was elevated to the dignity of a place in the 
	    <title level="j">Congressional Record</title>. It was then that the Negro reading public discovered him for 
	    themselves without any aid from their top-lofty mentors who are always "ready to bring 
	    forward young writers"â€”after they have been proclaimed by white critics.</p>

	    <p>Mr. McKay's slim little volume, <title level="m">Spring in New Hampshire and Other Poems</title>, which 
	    was published last year in London, is now before us. It reveals the author as a poet with 
	    a fine delicate technique and a curiously cultivated restraint. It is equally free from 
	    jingling and splurging and from the flaring fan-<choice><sic>tolds</sic><corr resp="cf" cert="low">folds</corr></choice> of the free-verse comedians who 
	    now hold the centre of the stage in that garish masquerade entitled "The New Poetry." 
	    The genuine breath of the tropics is felt in most of these poems, yet it seldom blows tornado 
	    blasts. The fine artistic feeling of the poet controls and tempers it to fine effects. 
	    Take, for instance, the last ten lines of "North and South":</p>

	    <quote source="#north-and-south">
	      <lg>
		<l>A breadth of idleness is in the air</l>
		<l rend="indent1">That casts a subtle spell upon all things,</l>
		<l>And love and mating-time are every-where,</l>
		<l rend="indent1">And wonder to life's commonplaces clings.</l>
		<l>The fluttering humming-bird darts through the trees</l>
		<l rend="indent1">And dips his long break in the big bell-flowers,</l>
		<l>The leisured buzzard floats upon the breeze</l>
		<l rend="indent1">Riding a crescent cloud for endless hours;</l>
		<l>The sea beats softly on the emerald strandsâ€”</l>
		<l rend="indent1">O sweet for dainty dreams are tropic lands!</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>

	    <p>It would have been very easy to vulgarize such a theme, to indulge in what Amy Lowell 
	    calls "lazy writing," and to tread the common ground of commonplace figures. Instead, 
	    we find that the words and the measure create <choice><sic>and</sic><corr resp="cf" cert="low">an</corr></choice> appropriate tone-color (or 
	    "atmosphere") in which the scene is set, and the nuances make a something that is finer 
	    than melody. The fourth line of the quoted portion is the golden touch of genius.</p>

	    <p>Sometimes the hidden melody of his verse is so fine that those who think that poetry 
	    is compounded of jingles and junk will fail to find it. But there it is just the same, like a 
	    theme of [Edward Alexander] McDowell's, waiting for the ear of beauty to find it, as in 
	    this half-stanza of his "Exhortation" (to Ethiopia):</p>

	    <quote source="#exhortation">
	      <lg>
		<l>In the East the clouds grow crimson with the new dawn that is breaking,</l>
		<l rend="indent1">And its golden glory fills the western skies:â€”</l>
		<l rend="indent1">Oh my brothers and my sisters, wake! Arise!</l>
		<l>For the new birth rends the old earth, and the very dead are waking.</l>
		<l rend="indent1">Ghosts are turned flesh, throwing off the grave's disguise,</l>
		<l rend="indent1">And the foolishâ€”even childrenâ€”are made wise;</l>
		<l>For the big earth groans in travail for the strong, new world in makingâ€”</l>
		<l rend="indent1">Oh my brothers, dreaming for long centuries,</l>
		<l rend="indent1">Wake from sleeping: to the East turn, turn your eyes!</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>

	    <p>This will stand the test of thinking and that quality of thought stands out in most of 
	    Mr. McKay's work. He means something. He doesn't let the rhyme rule the thought nor 
	    the ink guide the pen.</p>

	    <p>Perhaps the most arresting poem in this volume is the one entitled <ref target="#a-memory-of-june">"A Memory of 
	    June."</ref> Its theme is too intimate for reproduction here; but it is the one in which our 
	    poet comes nearest to letting himself go. <ref target="#the-lynching">"The Lynching,"</ref> <ref target="#on-broadway">"On Broadway,"</ref> <ref target="#harlem-shadows">"Harlem Shadows,"</ref> and <ref target="#the-harlem-dancer">"The Harlem Dancer"</ref> are noteworthy presentations of familiar themes.</p>

	    <p>We feel that the work of this poet should be better known. It is high in aim, in 
	    thought, in technique. And we gladly bespeak for this volume of genuine poetry a place 
	    in the affection of our folk.</p>

	    <p>Spring publications in the field 
	    of poetry are meagre. No one 
	    book of superior excellence 
	    stands out, although there are 
	    a number of volumes in which 
	    the public will take more or less interest...
	    </p>

	    <p>More conservative measures are to 
	    be discovered in "Harlem Shadows," 
	    by Claude McKay. This 
	    young negro is responsible for a 
	    bulk of poetry that seems quite new 
	    from his race. In the past we have 
	    judged the negro in poetry by Paul 
	    Lawrence Dunbar and other writers 
	    who kept more or less closely to the 
	    dialect medium. Mr. McKay does 
	    not employ dialect at all. He strives 
	    to portray the spirit of the modern 
	    negro in a high and lofty manner.</p>

	    <p>Most of the time he succeeds, although 
	    it must be admitted that certain 
	    portions of his book unravel 
	    into mere sentiment. Such efforts 
	    as his <ref target="#flame-heart">"Flame Heart,"</ref> however, 
	    <choice><sic>exhibihit</sic><corr>exhibit</corr></choice> admirably the deal of color 
	    that he can capture in his stanzas. 
	    This poem is too long to quote, so 
	    Mr. McKay must be represented by 
	    <ref target="#heritage">"Heritage,"</ref> a finely worded lyric 
	    of genuine strength</p>

	    <quote source="#heritage">

	      <p>For years the great poet has been regarded as the highest 
	      manifestation of the intellectual, esthetic, and in many cases spiritual, 
	      powers of a race. In the names that have come down through 
	      history it is those of the great poets that blaze out brightest. It 
	      is chiefly upon the achievements of such poets that races and 
	      peoples claim greatness for themselves.</p>

	      <p>There are, of course, four names which in their influence 
	      and appeal stand on a level with or even above the greatest poets. 
	      They are Buddha, Confucius, Christ and Mohammed. But these 
	      four great religious teachers were after all great ethical poets. 
	      Judged in every light they do represents the highest peaks of the 
	      genius of the races that produced them. But these names are 
	      limited to oriental races. No occidental race has yet produced 
	      a great religious teacher. Among the occidental peoples the great 
	      poet still stands almost unrivaled. There are other lists, of course, 
	      that contain names of wide influence and appeal. For example, 
	      that soldiers' list can show Alexander, CÃ¦sar and Napoleon. But 
	      there is not an occidental people in which the final test would not 
	      put its greatest poet above its greatest soldier.</p>
	      
	      <p>The times are slightly changed and the <choice><sic>glamor</sic><corr>glamour</corr></choice> about the 
	      poet may be somewhat dimmed. We are living in a very material 
	      age, and the man of science, the man who is able to bend 
	      the forces of nature to the well being of humanity is coming into 
	      <choice><sic>ascendency</sic><corr>ascendancy</corr></choice>. There may come a time when from achievements 
	      in science there will spring names that will shed a luster as bright 
	      and enduring as the names of Homer, Shakespeare, Dante, Moliere 
	      and Goethe.</p>

	      <p>However, to my mind, this is improbable. The materialism 
	      of the present age may be but a transitory state. Moreover, although 
	      the scientist may contribute what in the <choice><orig>ultilitarian</orig><corr>utilitarian</corr></choice> sense 
	      is far more important to humanity, he can never take hold of the 
	      imaginations of men and stir their souls like the poet. It therefore 
	      seems that as <choice><orig>lon gas</orig><corr>long as</corr></choice> man loves the beautiful the great poet 
	      will hold his supreme place.</p>
	    </div>

	    <div type="section">
	      <p>I have indulged in this rather weighty sounding introduction 
	      simply to induce a train of thought. I wish my readers to think 
	      of the production of poets by a race as a vital thing. It is vital 
	      not only as an indication of the development of the race but it is 
	      vital as to the place and recognition which that race is given 
	      by the world at large.</p>

	      <p>In accordance with the temper of the age, and more particularly, 
	      in accordance with false ideas with which the mind of 
	      the Negro in American has been impregnated, we Aframericans 
	      are prone to think of one of our number who conducts a successful 
	      corner grocery store as being far more vital and important as a 
	      factor in our progress than one who turns out a sheaf of poems, 
	      even though the poems are real poetry. We are prone to think of 
	      the grocer as one who is laying <sic>foundations</sic> stones in our racial 
	      greatness and of the poet as doing little more than wasting his 
	      time.</p>

	      <p>Without disparaging the successful grocer, I must say that 
	      this evaluation is all wrong. It would be interesting, if it were 
	      possible, to calculate how many successful Negro grocers it would 
	      take to equal the force of Paul Laurence Dunbar as a factor in 
	      the progress of the race and in having the progress recognized by 
	      the world. I am now driving at the truth contained in the words 
	      of Jesus Christ when He said, "Man shall not live by bread alone." 
	      If the race would develop its greatness and highest possibilities 
	      it needs not only to support its grocers but also to appreciate 
	      its poets.</p>
	    </div>

	    <div type="section">
	      <p>All this is merely introductory to a few words to call attention 
	      to a Negro poet who has risen like a new and flaming 
	      star on the horizon. The poet is Claude McKay.</p>

	      <p>Mr. McKay deserves a fully and prompt appreciation. We 
	      should not do in his case what were guilty of in the case of 
	      Dunbar, that was, not to recognize or not even to know his greatness 
	      until it was acclaimed by the whites.</p>

	      <p>Mr. McKay is a real poet and a great poet. I mean by this 
	      that he has both the poetic endowment and the ability to make 
	      that endowment articulate, and he is yet far from his full growth. 
	      He is still a young man. He is a poet of beauty and a poet of 
	      power. No Negro poet has sung more beautifully of his own race 
	      than McKay and no Negro poet has equalled the power with which 
	      he expresses the bitterness that so often rises in the heart of the 
	      race. As an example of that power we quote his sonnet, "If We 
	      Must Die," written after the <choice><sic>tetrrible</sic><corr>terrible</corr></choice> riots in the summer of 1919:
	      <quote source="#if-we-must-die">
		<lg>
		  <lg>
		    <l>If we must die, let it not be like hogs</l>
		    <l>Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,</l>
		    <l>While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,</l>
		    <l>Making their mock at our accursed lot.</l>
		    <l>If we must die, O let us nobly die,</l>
		    <l>So that our precious blood may not be shed</l>
		    <l>In vain: then even the monsters we defy</l>
		    <l>Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!</l>
		  </lg>

		  <lg>
		    <l>O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe!</l>
		    <l>Though far outnumbered let us show us brace,</l>
		    <l>And for their thousand blows deal one deathblow!</l>
		    <l>What though before us lies the open grave?</l>
		    <l>Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack,</l>
		    <l>Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!</l>
		  </lg>
		</lg>
	      </quote>
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>The race ought to be proud of a poet capable of voicing it so
	      fully. Such a voice is not found every day.</p>

	      <p>Mr. McKay's volume, "Harlem Shadows," published by Harcourt, 
	      Brace &amp; Company, New York, is already attracting the 
	      attention of the critics of the country. What he has achieved 
	      in this little volume sheds honor upon the whole race.</p>

		<note type="textual">The text of this review is taken from Tony Martin's <title level='m'>African Fundamentalism: A Literary and Cultural Anthology of Garvey's Harlem Renaissance</title> (Dover, MA: Majority Press, 1991): 69-70. Publication information comes from Cooper, <title level="m">Claude McKay: Rebel Sojourner in the Harlem Renaissance</title> (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State Univ. Press, 1987): 400:n83.</note>
		<note type="editorial">Cooper calls this "perhaps the longest and most appreciative review of <title level="j">Harlem Shadows</title>. Cooper quotes a letter from McKay to Kirnon in which McKay praises Kirnon's "real feeling" for his poetry. "I am so sick of pretentious critics posturing about creative work which they haven't the understanding heart to comprehend" (qtd. in Cooper 165-166).</note>

	    <p>This simple appreciation of Claude McKay's poems is done in obedience to 
	    an appreciative urge which is too strong and insistent to be ignored entirely. 
	    I trust that my readers will try and study it in the spirit in which it is offered. 
	    It is not a boost. Indeed, I can lay no claim to this peculiar virtue, if it is really 
	    such.</p>

	    <p>I remember first reading of Claude McKay in <title level='j'>Pearson's Magazine</title>. I think 
	    it was in the summer of 1918. I was then living out of this city. It was an autobiographical sketch with a few of his poems appended. I took no 
	    particular in the writer or his poems at this time. In fact, I mislaid the magazine before I had the opportunity of rereading the article. Then at a later 
	    date I cam across a poem entitled "Soul and Body" in Pearson's written by 
	    McKay. This poem made a profound impression upon me. From then up to 
	    this time I have entertained a profound interest and admiration for the 
	    writings of Mr. McKay.</p>

	    <p>In <title level='m'>Harlem Shadows</title> Claude McKay appears at good advantage. He 
	    exhibits ability and talent of no mean merit. I was suspicious of the soundness of 
	    Mr. Eric Walrond's ... <title level='j'>Negro World</title> review when he said that there was 
	    not a mediocre poem in the entire lot. But I now fully endorse his opinion 
	    with added emphasis. In every poem there is exhibited a remarkable and 
	    subtle balancing of thought and emotion of a nature that is rare indeed.
	    Nothing really essential to goody poetry is over-emphasized or sacrificed. A 
	    wonderful sense of harmony and completeness prevails throughout the entire 
	    volume. There is nowhere any attempt at being clever, big or showy. There 
	    is a complete absence of <sic resp="cf" cert="high">affection</sic>. His power lies in his simplicity. He does 
	    not choose "big" themes. He absolutely refuses to be imposed upon by 
	    himself with shallow and hollow pretenses. He follows with an unpretentious 
	    docility, his natural inclinations in the selection of themes. He seems to write 
	    under no other urge than that of natural impulse, and what seems strangely 
	    interesting is that his knowledge and impulse seem so strained towards 
	    perfection that no subject is being ill-treated by lack of treatment of over-treatment.</p>

	    <p>It is to Mr. McKay's credit that he does not specialize in any sort of 
	    propaganda themes, whether they be racial or otherwise. The big soul is 
	    universal. There are very few of his poems that would not make a universal 
	    human appeal regardless of time, place or circumstances. The spirit and 
	    thoughts expressed in his work are fundamental life experiences in some 
	    form or other in all human beings.</p>

	    <p>In order of arrangement the poem, "America," makes a very powerful 
	    appeal to me. I quote the first four lines:</p>

	    <quote>
	      <lg>
		<l>Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,</l>
		<l>And sinks into my throat her tiger's tooth,</l>
		<l>Stealing my breath of life, I will confess</l>
		<l>I love this cultured hell that tests my youth!</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>

	    <p>The last line truly expresses in a most satisfactory manner what I have 
	    always felt and thought to be the main redeeming feature of America. And I 
	    daresay many other aliens like myself have felt and thought in like manner 
	    without ever giving them expression.</p>

	    <p>McKay penetrates and probes to a depth not to be easily surpassed, the 
	    spiritual isolation and loneliness which many of usâ€”rich and poor, white 
	    and blackâ€”have felt quite often in the heart of the noise and bustle of this 
	    great city in the poem "On Broadway." He speaks for the many lonely, 
	    struggling, straggling souls that are stranded in awful loneliness amidst the 
	    great crowd.</p>

	    <p>An outstanding feature of McKay is his poetical fancy for things that 
	    appear even to the observant and responsive, meaningless and commonplace. 
	    At his hands they live and throb with life. They are humanized. As a typical 
	    example I take the "Subway Wind." I select the following lines, for they 
	    vividly portray the theme:</p>

	    <quote>
	      <lg>
		<l>Far down, down through the city's great, gaunt gut,</l>
		<l>The gray train rushing hears the weary wind;</l>
		<l>In the packed cars the fans the crowd's breath cut,</l>
		<l>Leaving the sick and heavy air behind.</l>
		<l>And pale-cheeked children seek the upper door</l>
		<l>To give their summer jackets to the breeze;</l>
		<l>Their laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar</l>
		<l>Of captive wind that moans for fields and seas.</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>

	    <p>Another pertinent feature of this volume of poems is that one really cannot 
	    be but conscious of the "genuine breath of the tropics," to use Mr. Hubert 
	    Harrison's words. A certain mildness and serenity pervades and permeates 
	    nearly every poem. McKay is a lover of nature. There are several poems 
	    dealing with one or the other aspect of nature. There are "The Easter Flower," 
	    "Winter in the Country," "To Winter," "Spring in New Hampshire," "North 
	    and South," and others. The last named is of excellent quality, and, in my 
	    humble estimation, can stand comparison with some of the best of William 
	    Cullen Bryant and the great English singer of nature, William Wordsworth.</p>

	    <p>But these are not all by any means. McKay touches philosophical themes. 
	    He contemplates upon matters metaphysical. In "I Know My Soul" he shows 
	    a poetical philosophical bent that was so strongly characteristic of Omar and 
	    Goethe.</p>

	    <p>In conclusion, I wish to say that I am convinced that Mr. Claude McKay 
	    possesses an exceptional poetical talent. He is an esthetician in the best sense 
	    of the word. He is true to himself. At least, I feel that I am justified in making 
	    this statement. An honest work which is expressive of one's individuality is 
	    art in the creative sense. Imitation is always superficial at best when not made 
	    subordinate to the individual personality. Esthetic beauty is greater and 
	    beyond objective beauty. And this McKay seems to know. He records his 
	    own deepest soul experience in his most intense moods and, in so doing, he 
	    holds before his readers a true picture of their inner life; and in this 
	    recognition of self lies the possibility of spiritual growth. To understand and 
	    appreciate Claude McKay's poems, one must be capable of studying and 
	    understanding life through the emotions; for a sympathetic and appreciative 
	    understanding is possible only through the feelings.</p>

	      <p>One of the poets whom James Weldon 
	      Johnson quotes in his "Book of American 
	      Negro Poetry," himself defines unconsciously 
	      the significance of this collection. 
	      This poet, Charles Bertram Johnson, after 
	      noting in the development of Negro Poets 
	      "the greater growing reach of larger latent 
	      power," declares:
	      <quote>
		<lg>
		  <l>We wait our Lyric Seer,</l>
		  <l>By whom our wills are caught.</l>
		  <l>Who makes our cause and wrong</l>
		  <l>The motif of his song;</l>
		  <l>Who sings our racial good,</l>
		  <l>Bestows us honor's place,</l>
		  <l>The cosmic brotherhood</l>
		  <l>Of geniusâ€”not of race.</l>
		</lg>
	      </quote>
	      </p>
	      <p>Not all of the 32 poets quoted here give 
	      evidence of this cosmic quality, but 
	      there is a fair showing, notably Mrs. Georgia 
	      Douglas Johnson whose power however is 
	      checked by the narrowness of her medium 
	      of expression, Claude McKay and Anne 
	      Spencer. Of Claude McKay I shall speak 
	      later, but I wonder why we have not heard 
	      more of Anne Spencer. Her art and its 
	      expression are true and fine; she blends 
	      a delicate mysticism with a diamond clearness 
	      of exposition, and her subject matter 
	      is original.</p>
	      <p>This anthology itself has the value of an 
	      arrow pointing the direction of Negro 
	      genius, but the author's preface has a more 
	      immediate worth. It is not only a graceful 
	      bit of expository writing befitting a collection 
	      of poetry, but it affords a splendid 
	      compendium of the Negro's artistic contributions 
	      to America. Mr. Johnson feels 
	      that the Negro is the author of the only 
	      distinctively American artistic products. 
	      He lists his gifts as follows: Folk-tales 
	      such as we find in the Joel Chandler Harris 
	      collection; the Spirituals; the Cakewalk 
	      and Ragtime. What is still more important 
	      is the possession on the part of the Negro 
	      of what Mr. Johnson calls a "transfusive 
	      quality," that is the ability to adopt the 
	      original spirit of his milieu into something 
	      "artistic and original, which yet possesses 
	      the note of universal appeal."</p>
	    </div>
	    <div type="section">
	      <p>The first thought that will flash into the 
	      mind of the reader of "Harlem Shadows" 
	      will be: <hi rend="italics">"This is poetry!"</hi> No other later 
	      discovery, a slight unevenness of power, a 
	      strange rhythm, the fact of the author's 
	      ancestry, will be able to affect that first 
	      evaluation. Mr. McKay possesses a deep 
	      emotionalism, a perception of what is 
	      fundamentally important to mankind everywhereâ€”love 
	      of kind, love of home, and love 
	      of race. He is extraordinarily vivid in depicting 
	      these last two. <ref target="#flame-heart">"Flameheart"</ref> and 
	      <ref target="#my-mother">"My Mother"</ref> fill even the casual reader 
	      with a sense of longing for home and the 
	      first, fine love for parents. The warmth 
	      and sweetness of those days described in 
	      the former poem are especially alluring; 
	      the mind is caught the concept of the 
	      poinsettia's redness as the eye is fixed by 
	      a flash of color. But Mr. McKay's nobler 
	      effort has been spent in the poems of 
	      <ref target="#america">"America"</ref> (quoted in this issue's <title rend="italics">Looking 
	      Glass</title>) is the finest example. He has dwelt 
	      in fiery, impassioned language on the sufferings 
	      of his race. Yet there is no touch 
	      of propaganda. This is the truest mark of 
	      genius.</p>
	      <p>Max Eastman prefaces these poems with 
	      a thoughtful and appreciative foreword.</p>

	    <pb n="530" />
	    <p>There are few Americans of 
	    culture who have not heard and 
	    been thrilled by the weird, plaintive 
	    negro spirituals. There are others 
	    who know that modern jazz music was 
	    born of musically illiterate negro 
	    roustabouts on Mississippi levees. 
	    There are yet others who know of the 
	    beautiful dialect poetry of Paul Laurence 
	    Dunbar, and of the writings of 
	    Dr. DuBois, one of the great masters 
	    of prose in America.</p>

	    <p>Beyond these cultural gifts to 
	    <pb n="531" />
	    America, however, all that the negro 
	    has given us in the arts has been a 
	    closed book. A step toward acquainting 
	    America with these no inconsiderable 
	    gifts has been taken by James 
	    Weldon Johnson in "The Book of 
	    American Negro Poetry." Mr. Johnson 
	    is eminently qualified to undertake 
	    such a task, for he is recognized 
	    as one of the two foremost poets of 
	    his race and indeed, as one of the few 
	    worth while poets of America, regardless 
	    of race. He has gathered and 
	    examined the work of more than one 
	    hundred negro poets and carefully 
	    culled the best that has been done by 
	    thirty-one of them. Aside form the 
	    excellence of much of the verse, the 
	    most striking thing, even to the casual 
	    reader, is the versatility of these 
	    writers. There is much of good dialect 
	    but only a small portion is in that 
	    form. There is the colorful imaginative 
	    poetry of Anne Spencer in her 
	    "Before the Feast of Shushan," the 
	    strength of thought and charm of 
	    phrasing of Claude McKay, the 
	    lyrical beauty of Jessie Fauset, the emotionalism 
	    of Georgia Douglas Johnson, the 
	    polished modernity of William Stanley 
	    Braithwaite, the vigor and satire of 
	    James Weldon Johnson's protest 
	    against lynching in "Brothers" as well 
	    as the tenderness of his "Since You 
	    Went Away." It is but natural that 
	    the negro should <sic>propagandic</sic>â€”his 
	    lot in American never lets him forget 
	    that he is a "problem"â€”his is a bitter 
	    struggle for mere existence. Yet, 
	    many of the writers have been able 
	    to transcend racial lines, forgetting 
	    race problems in imaginative flights 
	    of rare beauty. Space forbids my 
	    quoting, to my regret. I would like 
	    to offer exhibits showing the wealth 
	    within its covers that makes the book 
	    so great a joy.</p>

	    <p>To me the most important and valuable 
	    portion of the book is the preface 
	    of some forty pages by Mr. Johnson 
	    on "The Creative Genius of the American 
	    Negro." In this he shows that 
	    the negro "is the creator of the only 
	    things artistic that have yet sprung 
	    from American soil and been universally 
	    acknowledged as distinctive 
	    American products." These are four 
	    in number: the Uncle Remus stories, 
	    America's only folk lore; the negro 
	    folk songs or spirituals; the cakewalk, 
	    which is distinctly American and from 
	    which sprang the modern society 
	    dances; and ragtime with its "great 
	    melodic beauty and amazing polyphonic 
	    structure." To read this essay 
	    is to gain a liberal education on the 
	    source of much of the few contributions 
	    America has made to the arts. 
	    If Americans knew and appreciated 
	    fully all that the negro has given to 
	    America, the race problem would be 
	    easy of solution.</p>

	    <p>Coincident with the publication of 
	    Mr. Johnson's book comes Claude 
	    McKay's "Harlem Shadows." Here is 
	    a young man, born in the British West 
	    Indies, who is without doubt the most 
	    talented and versatile of the new 
	    school of imaginative, emotional 
	    negro poets. Feeling intensely, at 
	    times bitterly, he succeeds, nevertheless, 
	    in preventing his emotions from 
	    affecting his genius as a poet. He has 
	    surety of expression, depth of feeling, 
	    the true lyric gift, and handles amazingly 
	    well subtle gradations of 
	    thought and of feeling. Mr. McKay 
	    is not a great negro poetâ€”he is a great 
	    poet! This is his first book of verse 
	    to be published in the United States, 
	    but it will give him the high place 
	    among American poets to which he is 
	    rightfully entitled. I offer in evidence 
	    one of his shorter poems on which I 
	    ground my belief:
	    <pb n="532" />
	    <quote source="#poetry">
	      <lg type="poem">
		<l>Sometimes I tremble like a storm-swept flower,</l>
		<l>And seek to hide my tortured soul from thee,</l>
		<l>Bowing my head in deep humility</l>
		<l>Before the silent thunder of thy power.</l>
		<l>Sometimes I flee before thy blazing light,</l>
		<l>As from the specter of pursuing death;</l>
		<l>Intimated lest thy mighty breath,</l>
		<l>Windways, will sweep me into utter night.</l>
		<l>For, oh, I fear they will be swallowed upâ€”</l>
		<l>The loves that are to me of vital worth,</l>
		<l>My passion and my pleasure in the earthâ€”</l>
		<l>And lost forever in thy magic cup!</l>
		<l>I fear, I fear my truly human heart</l>
		<l>Will perish on the altar-stone of art!</l>

	    <p>If it were possible to read Mr. Johnson's collection without 
	    knowing that all of it was written by Negroes, it 
	    is rather unlikely that one would think it remarkable in 
	    any way. One would be struck, here and there, by a certain 
	    simplicity, or technical competence, or musically flowing 
	    rhythm, or warmth of feeling, or occasional vivid 
	    phrase. Longer than any of these things, which are to be 
	    found in fairly good poetry anywhere, one would remember 
	    flashes of an aching indissoluble bitterness, a white anger 
	    stripped of all merely personal unhappiness, which, if one 
	    did not know by what oppressed it was uttered and against 
	    what oppressor, would be puzzling and disquieting.</p>

	    <p>But since it is known who wrote them, it is impossible 
	    to read these poems as one reads most poetry. There arise 
	    at once, from the auction block and cotton field and lynching 
	    post and Harlem slum, the faces of our dark step-children, 
	    whom we have mistreated and misunderstood, 
	    whose time of trouble is not yet over, who are struggling 
	    painfully out of darkness toward some degree of happiness 
	    in an alien land. We think of the general assumptionâ€”which 
	    has always been the master's excuse for keeping 
	    down the slaveâ€”that they are essentially inferior to us. 
	    Perhaps they are inferior in many of the things which our 
	    civilization likes to think are importantâ€”who can say so 
	    for sure? And who can say for sure that they are not 
	    our equals in some things, and in others even our betters?</p>

	    <p>They have their own fields to plough, which are not 
	    ours. The only music native to America is theirs; and in 
	    its particular quality of spontaneity, of free rhythm and 
	    rich harmonies, only possible in an uncomplicated spirit very 
	    near to the earth, there is nothing else like it in the world.</p>

	    <p>Is poetry one of their fields? Impossible to say as yet. 
	    On the strength of this collection by Negroesâ€”nearly all 
	    now livingâ€”it is clear that they can write poetry as good 
	    as the great mass of ours, and they have produced one 
	    real poet, though by no means a great oneâ€”Mr. Claude 
	    McKay. It is an uneven collection. Too much of it is 
	    in the tradition of echoes, flowery phrase and emotion 
	    vaguely expressed which have always afflicted poetry. Too 
	    much of it is <choice><sic>modelled</sic><corr>modeled</corr></choice> after what is least worth copying. 
	    A good deal of it is in dialect, which always leaves me uneasy. 
	    Print cools and distorts phrases which, when spoken 
	    or sung, have a charming spontaneous gusto. Mr. 
	    Du Bois' "A Litany at Atlanta" is impressive, but as 
	    poetry is buttered to thick with indignation. Mr. Braithwaite's 
	    Sandy Star stirs pleasantly, like a light wind. Miss 
	    Spencer has great mastery over dreamy, half-mystical melodies. 
	    Mr. Fenton Johnson has a fine gift for direct observation 
	    and biting phrase in short prose poems whose 
	    reality makes him perhaps the most original contributor 
	    to the collection, though Mr. Claude McKay is by far 
	    the ablest poet.</p>

	    <p>I cannot quite agree with Mr. Max Eastman that Mr. 
	    McKay <quote source="#introduction">"reminds us of Burns and Villon and Catullus."</quote> 
	    I feel that a hospitality to echoes of poetry he has read 
	    has time and again obscured a direct sense of life, and made 
	    rarer those lines of singular intensity which express as 
	    Mr. Eastman aptly says, "the naked force of character." 
	    I am sorry he so often uses such indoor and inbred poetic 
	    phrases as <quote source="#to-one-coming-north">"the Northland wreathed in golden smiles,"</quote> 
	    <quote source="#flame-heart">"I have forgot what time the purple apples..."</quote>, or <quote source="#adolescence">"'neath the floating moon,"</quote> when he is capable of the stark sincerity of <title level="a">Harlem Shadows</title> or <title level="a">Spring in New Hampshire,</title>
	    or the poignancy of <ref target="#the-barrier"><title level="a">The Barrier</title></ref>.</p>
	    
	    <p>If Mr. McKay and the other poets don't stir us unusually 
	    when they travel over poetic roads so many others have 
	    <choice><sic>travelled</sic><corr>traveled</corr></choice> before them, they make us sit up and take notice 
	    when they write about their race and ours. They strike 
	    hard, and pierce deep. It is not a merely emotion 
	    that they express, but something fierce, and constant, and 
	    icy cold, and white hot. We believe Mr. Johnson 
	    when he says that <quote>"the Negro in the United States is consuming 
	    all of his energy in this <choice><sic>gruelling</sic><corr>grueling</corr></choice> race struggle."</quote> 
	    For it is the common thread running all through the book. 
	    It ranges from the restraint of Mr. Corrothers: <quote>"To be 
	    a Negro in a day like this demands rare patienceâ€”patience 
	    that can wait in utter darkness"</quote>; through Mr. Johnson's 
	    own bitter lines:

	    <quote>
	      <lg>
		<l>Lessons in degradation, taught and learned,</l>
		<l>The memories of cruel sights and deeds,</l>
		<l>The pent-up bitterness, the unspent hate,</l>
		<l>Filtered through fifteen generations. . . .</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>
	    
	    to Mr. McKay's bitterness (in <title level="a">To the White Fiends</title>), 
	    when he writes

	    <quote>
	      <lg>
		<l>Think you I could not arm me with a gun</l>
		<l>And shoot down ten of you for every one</l>
		<l>Of my black brothers murdered, burnt by you?</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>

	    is only speaking for thousands of his race who feel the 
	    same hatredâ€”hatred which boils over once in a while, 
	    as we know, but breaks in ineffectual waves on the stony 
	    white shore, and turns to something like the bottomless 
	    despair, felt by Mr. Fenton Johnson:

	    <quote>
	      <lg>
		<l>I am tired of work; I am tired of building up somebody else's civilization. . . .</l>
		<l>Throw the children into the river; civilization has given us too many. It is better to die than it is to grow up and find out that your are colored.</l>

	    <p><title><hi rend="bold">Harlem Shadows</hi></title>. By Claude McKay,
	    with an introduction by Max Eastman. Published by Harcourt, 
	    Brace, &amp; Company, New York. Price $1.75.</p>
	    <p>The poems in this book are characterized
	    by wide range of subject 
	    and a distinct gift for poetic
	    diction. The writer of them has a 
	    poet's soul. They have also the touch 
	    which marks them as the work of one 
	    of African descent.</p>
	    <p>Love of the tropics and its life
	    breathes through the lines of many: 
	    some refer wistfully to childhood
	    memories, as in contrast to the stern 
	    realities of the North, and the city. 
	    Old loves, old ties, old scenes have 
	    strong hold on the writer; the hard 
	    facts of life as it must be lived by 
	    a Negro in an Anglo-Saxon civilization 
	    press hard on his sensitive soul. 
	    His eyes are open to all its artistic 
	    possibilities, however, and he voices 
	    truthfully what he sees. Nature 
	    has given to Mr. McKay the gift of 
	    a singer, so that whatever mode or 
	    rhythm he adopts, it is satisfying 
	    and melodious. No free verse is 
	    here, although classic rules are 
	    treated freely, and he knows instinctively 
	    how to use words in a way that 
	    shows both culture and melody.</p>
	    <p>These poems seem to the writer 
	    marred by two faults, however, not 
	    of vision or of expression, but of 
	    the poet's mentality. Mr. McKay 
	    thinks, it appears, in terms both
	    negative and garish. His subjects 
	    are of things past, things longed for,
	    things absent, or things tragic. The 
	    positive, inspirational note, which 
	    we associate with poetry at its best,
	    is conspicuous by its absence, so that
	    one seems to be hearing too much 
	    music in the minor key. When he 
	    does touch a more positive note, he
	    becomes lurid, not in word but in 
	    thought, touching his subject in 
	    strong, glaring colors; his work at 
	    such times lacks taste. His mind 
	    seems to be a dark place lit up by 
	    fitful rays of passion, not a clear, 
	    bright place where one loves to linger.
	    <pb n="442" /> The book is well named 
	    "Harlem Shadows." In Claude McKay 
	    another minor poet has spoken.</p>

	  <p>James Weldon Johnson, in the sound 
	  and aggressive foreword to his collection, "The
	  Book of American Negro Poetry," says that the 
	  negro is the creator of the only things artistic that 
	  have yet sprung from American soil and been universally 
	  acknowledged as distinctive American products. 
	  The four exhibits that he cites are the Uncle Remus 
	  folk talks, the spirituals or slave songs, the cakewalk 
	  and negro dancing, and ragtime. Let him grant to 
	  the Caucasian Walt Whitman's polyrhythms, and to 
	  the Amerind basket weaving and blanket designs, and 
	  the list is complete. In all fields artistic the negro is 
	  leaving a proud mark, the present volume being one 
	  of the best of his contributions to the awkward poetry 
	  of <choice><orig>to-day</orig><reg>today</reg></choice>.</p>

	  <p>Claude McKay was born in the island of Jamaica, 
	  in 1890. Before he was twenty-two he had composed 
	  many songs in the haunting dialect of the islanders; 
	  he is said to have been the first poet to have written 
	  in this dialect. In 1912 the medal of the Institute 
	  of Arts and Sciences was awarded him, in recognition 
	  of his <choice><orig>preÃ«minence</orig><reg>preeminence</reg></choice>; he was the first negro to be 
	  awarded the medal. That same year he came to the 
	  United States, and since then has earned his living in 
	  all the jumbled ways that working-class negroes of 
	  the North turn to. But his main goals were life 
	  and song, and to these he has paid his chief allegiance. 
	  He is one of the editors of <title level='j'>The Liberator</title>, and is yet 
	  young in his singing.</p>

	  <p>Mr. McKay is highly effective as a propagandist. 
	  Upon those racial themes which demand so clarion a 
	  voice and so impelling a music he is not lacking:

	  <quote source="#enslaved">
	    <lg type='poem'>
	      <head>ENSLAVED</head>
	      
	      <l>Oh, when I think of my long-suffering race,</l>
	      <l>For weary centuries despised, oppressed,</l>
	      <l>Enslaved and lynched, denied a human place</l>
	      <l>In the great life line of the Christian West;</l>
	      <l>And in the Black Land disinherited,</l>
	      <l>Robbed in the ancient country of its birth.</l>
	      <l>My heart grows sick with hate, becomes as lead,</l>
	      <l>For this my race that has no home on earth.</l>
	      <l>Then from the dark depths of my soul I cry</l>
	      <l>To the avenging angel to consume</l>
	      <l>The whit man's world of wonders utterly:</l>
	      <l>Let it be swallowed up in earth's vast womb,</l>
	      <l>Or upward roll as sacrificial smoke,</l>
	      <l>To liberate my people from its yoke!</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  "The Lynching" has power and majesty, from its 
	  momentous opening to the sardonic throb at the endâ€”

	  <quote>
	    <lg>
	      <l>And little lads, lynchers that were to be,</l>
	      <l>Danced round the dreadful thing in fiendish glee.</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  "If We Must Die" is a powerful call to battle; this 
	  trinity of sonnets is one of the most effective things 
	  ever done upon the theme. It compares favorably with 
	  Du Bois's "Litany," with James Weldon Johnson's 
	  "Brothers"; it is superior to William Ellery Leonard's 
	  "The Lynching Bee."</p>

	  <p>As stark realist, such poems as "On the Road," a 
	  reminiscence of his dining car days, and the title poem 
	  and "The Harlem Dancer" for another phase of life, 
	  are vivid and gripping. Nor is he too close to the 
	  writhing to achieve the poet's penetrating detachment, 
	  as evidence in a line like this from "In Bondage":

	  <quote source="#in-bondage">
	    <lg>
	      <l>O black men, simple slaves of ruthless slaves.</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  He is both doer and seer in "America":
	  
	  <quote source="#america">
	    <lg>
	      <l>Although she . . . </l>
	      <l> . . . sinks into my throat her tiger's tooth . . .</l>
	      <l>I love this cultured hell that tests my youth!</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  His tributes to his mother, especially the one with the 
	  line "The best of me is the but the least of you," are finely 
	  thought, and wrought as well. If he sometimes strays 
	  into an experiment as weak as

	  <quote>
	    <lg>
	      <l>And the tethered cow is lowing, lowing, lowing,</l>
	      <l>And dear old Ned is braying, braying, braying,</l>
	      <l>And the shaggy Nannie goat is calling, calling, calling,</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  this is forgiven for the loveliness of his love songs, 
	  "Romance," "Flower of June," "The Snow Fairy," 
	  "A Memory of June," and especially the bird-like 
	  opening of "The Barrier":

	  <quote>
	    <lg>
	      <l>I must not gaze at them although</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">Your eyes are dawning day;</l>
	      <l>I must not watch you as you go</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">Your sun-illumined way;</l>
	    </lg>
	    <lg>
	      <l>I hear but I must never heed</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">The fascinating note,</l>
	      <l>Which, fluting like a river reed,</l>

	  </quote>
	  </p>

	  <p>Mr. McKay is a lyric poet of strength and grace, 
	  with many varied keys to his playing. He is not an 
	  innovator in technique; Fenton Johnson and Anne 
	  Spencer, among negro poets, have gone much further 
	  in the newer modes of singing. But modernness is 
	  more than method. Mr. McKay's verse is free of 
	  the stilted pseudo-poetic vocabulary of the Amaranth-Asphodel 
	  poetlings, as of the inversions and verbal 
	  circumambulations of the What Time sonneteers and 
	  the Like As lyricists. His verse is modern in its 
	  directness and simplicity, its vigor and variety.</p>

	    <p>This sketch is not an attempt at authentic and prolonged 
	    criticism of Claude McKay's delightful "Harlem Shadows"â€”only 
	    a reaction, impulsive and personal.</p>

	    <p>Read "The Harlem Dancer":</p>

	    <quote source='#the-harlem-dancer'>
	      <lg type='poem'>
		<l>"Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes</l>
		<l>And watched her perfect, half-clothed body sway;</l>
		<l>Her voice was like the sound of blended flutes</l>
		<l>Blown by black players upon a picnic day.</l>
		<l>She sang and danced on, gracefully and calm,</l>
		<l>The light gauze hanging loose about her form;</l>
		<l>To me she seemed a proudly-swaying palm</l>
		<l>Grown lovelier for passing through a storm.</l>
		<l>Upon her swarthy neck black shiny curls</l>
		<l>Luxuriant fell; and tossing coins in praise,</l>
		<l>The wine flushed, bold-eyed boys and even the girls,</l>
		<l>Devoured her shape with eager passionate gaze;</l>
		<l>But looking at her falsely-smiling face,</l>
		<l>I knew her self was not in that strange place."</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>

	    <p>Unfadingly canvassed are the lines: "To me she seemed a 
	    proudly swaying palm," etc., and, "her voice was like the 
	    sound of blended flutes," one can hear the magic tones. This 
	    picture of the lovely Harlem Dancer is as vividly painted 
	    on my mind as is the Mona Liza.</p>

	    <p>Vital and living is "Harlem Shadows":</p>

	    <quote source='#harlem-shadows'>
	      <lg>
		<l>"I hear the halting footsteps of a lass</l>
		<l rend='indent1'>In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall</l>
		<l>Its veil. I see the shapes of girls who pass</l>
		<l rend='indent1'>To bend and barter at desires call.</l>
		<l>Ah, little dark girls who in slippered feet</l>
		<l rend='indent1'>Go prowling through the night from street to street!"</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>

	    <pb n='717' />

	    <p>The flame-shod feet of "the little dark girls" pass over my 
	    heart and I feel that touch of anguish that was the author's 
	    own when he wrote these lines.</p>

	    <p>The prophecy in the last four lines of "America" is signfiicant:</p>

	    <quote source="#america">
	      <lg>
		<l>"Darkly I gaze into the days ahead,</l>
		<l>And see her might and granite wonders there,</l>
		<l>Beneath the touch of Time's unerring hand</l>
		<l>Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand."</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>

	    <p>It is the unmistakable writing on the wall, and yet what 
	    tender compassion pervades the author, who continues:</p>

	    <quote source="#america">
	      <lg>
		<l>"I stand within her walls with not a shred</l>
		<l>Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer."</l>

	    <note type="editorial"><p>When these McKay published two sonnets in <title level="j">Seven Arts</title>, he had already published collections of poetry under his own name in Jamaica. However, when he began publishing poems  in the United States he used a pen name, a masculinization of his mother's name, Hannah Ann Elizabeth Edwards (see Cooper 26). McKay expains in his autobiography, "The nom de plume was adapted from my mother's name. I used it because at the time when the poems were submitted, I was a waiter at a women's club. The members were students of the arts. Some were literary aspirants and were always reading and discussing the new and little magazines. As I was a good enough waiter I did not care to be discovered as a poet there" (<title level='m'>Long Way from Home</title> 26).</p>

	    <p>I am a black man, born in Jamaica, <choice><abbr>B.W.I.</abbr><expan>British West Indies</expan></choice>, and 
	    have been living in America for the last six years. 
	    During my first year's residence in America I 
	    wrote the following group of poems. It was the first 
	    time I had ever come face to face with such manifest, 
	    implacable hate of my race, and my feelings were indescribable. 
	    I sent them so that you may see what my 
	    state of mind was at the time. I have written nothing 
	    similar to them since and don't think I ever shall 
	    again.</p>

	    <p>The whites at home constitute about 14 per cent. of 
	    the population only and they generally conform to the 
	    standard of English respectability. The few poor ones 
	    accept their fate resignedly and live at peace with the 
	    natives. The government is tolerant, somewhat benevolent, 
	    based on the principle of equal justice to all.
	    I had heard of prejudice in America but never dreamed 
	    of it being so intensely bitter; for at home there is also 
	    prejudice of the English sort, subtle and dignified, 
	    rooted in class distinctionâ€”color and race being hardly 
	    taken into account.</p>

	    <p>It was such an atmosphere I left for American to find 
	    here strong white men, splendid types, of better physique 
	    than any I had ever seen, exhibiting the most 
	    primitive animal hatred towards their weaker black 
	    brothers. In the South daily murders of a nature most 
	    hideous and revolting, in the North silent acquiescence, 
	    deep hate half-hidden under a puritan respectability, 
	    oft flaming up into an occasional lynchingâ€”this ugly 
	    raw sore in the body of a great nation. At first I was 
	    horrified, my spirit revolted against the ignoble cruelty 
	    and blindness of it all. Then I soon found myself 
	    hating in return; but this feeling couldn't last long 
	    for to hate is to be miserable.</p>

	    <p>Looking about me with bigger and clearer eyes I 
	    saw that this cruelty in different ways was going on 
	    all over the world. Whites were exploiting and oppressing 
	    whites even as they exploited and oppressed 
	    the yellows and blacks. And the oppressed, groaning 
	    under the lash, evinced the same despicable hate and 
	    harshness towards their weaker fellows. I ceased to 
	    think of people and things in the massâ€”why should 
	    I fight with mad dogs only to be bitten and probably 
	    transformed into a mad dog myself? I turned to the 
	    individual soul, the spiritual leaders, for comfort and 
	    consolation. I felt and still feel that one must seek 
	    for the noblest and best in the individual life only: 
	    each soul must save itself.</p>

	    <p>And now this great catastrophe has come upon the 
	    world proving the real hollowness of nationhood, patriotism, 
	    racial pride and most of the things which one 
	    was taught to respect and reverence.</p>

	    <p>There is very little to tell of my uneventful career. 
	    I was born in the heart of the little island of Jamaica 
	    on the 15th of September, 1889. My grandparents 
	    were slaves, my parents free-born. My mother was 
	    very sweet-natured, fond of books; my father, honest, 
	    stern even to harshness, hard working, beginning 
	    empty-handed he coaxed a good living from the soil, 
	    bought land, and grew to be a comparatively prosperous 
	    small settler. A firm believer in education, he tried to 
	    give all his eight children the best he could afford.</p>

	    <p>I was the last child and when I was nine years old 
	    my mother sent me to my eldest brother who was a 
	    schoolmaster in the northwestern part of the island.</p>

	    <p>From that time on I became interested in books. 
	    The school building, to which was attached the teacher's 
	    cottage, was an old slave house, plain, substantial 
	    and comfortable. My brother, an amateur journalist, 
	    country correspondent for the city papers, was fond 
	    of good books and possessed a nice libraryâ€”all the 
	    great English masters and a few translations from the 
	    ancients. Not caring very much for play and having 
	    plenty of leisure I spent nearly all my time out of school 
	    reading. I read whatever pleased my fancy, secretly 
	    scribbling in prose and verse at the same time. Novels, 
	    history, bible literature, tales in verse like Scott's I 
	    read, and nearly all Shakespeare's plays for the absorbing 
	    story interest. As yet I couldn't perceive the 
	    truths. Now, looking back, I can see that that was 
	    the great formative period of my lifeâ€”a time of perfect 
	    freedom to play, read and think as I liked.</p>

	    <p>I finished elementary school with my brother and 
	    helped him to teach while studying further under him. 
	    In 1906 I passed an examination for the Government 
	    Trade Scholarship and was apprenticed to a wheelwright 
	    and cabinet maker. But I couldn't learn a 
	    trade.</p>

	    <p>At this time I began writing verses of Jamaica 

	    <pb n="276" />

	    peasant life in the negro dialect. I met an Englishman 
	    who loved good books and their makes more than 
	    anything else. He opened up a new world to my view, 
	    introduced me to a greater, deeper literatureâ€”to 
	    Buddha, Schopenhauer and Goethe, Carlyle and 
	    Browning, Wilde, Carpenter, Whitman, Hugo, Verlaine, 
	    Baudelaire, Shaw and the different writers of 
	    the Rationalist Pressâ€”more than I had time to read, 
	    but nearly all my spare time I spent listening to his 
	    reading choice bits from them, discussing the greatness 
	    of their minds, and telling of their lives, which I must 
	    confess I sometimes found even more interesting than 
	    their works.</p>

	    <p>Trade proved a failure. I gave it up, joined the 
	    Jamaica Constabulary 1910-11, despised it and left. 
	    With Mr. Jekyll's help, the Englishman mentioned before, 
	    my <title level="m">Songs of Jamaica</title> was published at this time. 
	    I went home and farmed rather half-heartedly. The 
	    government was then encouraging the younger men to 
	    acquire a scientific agricultural education so that it 
	    could employ them to teach the peasantry modern ways 
	    of farming. I came to America in 1912 to study agriculture, 
	    went to Tuskegee, but not liking the semi-military, 
	    machinelike existence, I left for the 
	    Kansas State College where I stayed two years.</p>

	    <p>In the summer of 1914 I came to New York with a 
	    friend. We opened a little restaurant among our 
	    people which also proved a failure because I didn't put all 
	    my time and energy into it.</p>

	    <p>After a while I got married, but my wife wearied of 
	    the life in six months and went back to Jamaica. I 
	    hated to go back after having failed at nearly everything 
	    so I just stayed here and worked desultorilyâ€”porter, 
	    houseman, janitor, butler, waiterâ€”anything 
	    that came handy. The life was different and fascinating 
	    and one can do menial work here and feel like a 
	    man sometimes, so I didn't mind it.</p>

	    <p>I am a waiter on the railroad now. Here are a few 
	    of my poems.</p>

	    </head>

	    <p>On the face of the facts, both as to the 
	    origin and the immediate (fighting) results 
	    of the Washington and Chicago race 
	    riots, the Negro certainly has nothing to be 
	    ashamed of and nothing to regretâ€”save the 
	    casualties and sufferings which of necessity 
	    were the portion of both groups of 
	    participants. And he has many reasons for 
	    a justifiable pride in the prowess and resource 
	    displayed by the men and women 
	    of his race who were forced to take up arms 
	    in <choice><orig>defence</orig><reg>defense</reg></choice> of their lives and homes, and 
	    who, with their "backs to wall," fighting 
	    over the Battle of Democracy, showed themselves 
	    the superiors in courage, resource 
	    and "civilized warfare" of their 
	    white opponents and, terribly outnumbered 
	    though they were, more than held their 
	    own, hitting back in hard, telling blows that 
	    had more effect in discouraging the murderous 
	    lust of white hoodlums and ruffians 
	    than any act on the part of the local and 
	    military authorities.</p>

	    <p>And in both cases the Negro had an undeniable 
	    "moral case." Both in Washington 
	    and in Chicago the white man plainly 
	    was the aggressor. And the aggressor on 
	    no excusable or condonable grounds! In 
	    Washington whit marines and soldiers, 
	    travelling in groups, attacked and beat up 
	    lone colored men because of recent alleged 
	    attacks by Negroes on white women. In 
	    Chicago white bathers stoned to death a 
	    small colored boy whose drifting raft had 
	    carried him across the "white section" of 
	    the lake front!</p>

	    <p>But while both riots were caused by 
	    white aggression and while both have many 
	    features in common there are certain 
	    shameful things that occurred in Washington 
	    that, happily, were not duplicated in 
	    Chicago. For this reason, then, the two 
	    riots should be considered separately.</p>
	    
	    <div>
	      <head>The Washington Riot</head>

	      <p>Without a doubt the Washington trouble 
	      could have been averted had the Capital 
	      police taken prompt measures in suppression 
	      of the mob spirit of the white marines
	      and soldiers. And quite probably, too, the 
	      Chicago trouble would not have occurred 
	      so soon, though observers seem to agree 
	      that it was fated to come. But the Washington 
	      police took no steps to suppress the 
	      disorderly conduct of the white mobs during 
	      the days when they were beating up 
	      Negroes and "shooting up" the Negro sections 
	      with the colored people quiescent, 
	      long-suffering and patiently waiting for 
	      action on the part of the police to suppress 
	      the disorder and re-establish the reign of 
	      Law and Order. The white papers themselves 
	      report that:</p>

	      <quote>"During the troubles on the first 
	      two nights the police made no effort 
	      to stop the White mobs. They 
	      seemed to consider it was none of 
	      their business..."</quote>

	      <p>General attacks on Negroes began on 
	      July 19 and for two full days the white 
	      mobs had a merry, unopposed blood-picnic 
	      while the white Washington police stood 
	      by in the role of benevolent neutrals and 
	      the colored police were detached from duty
	      because, as The Globe reported:</p>

	      <quote>"The attacks by service men on 
	      Negroes were so general that 
	      uniformed Negro policemen were detached 
	      from duty and sent home 
	      by the authorities."</quote>

	      <p>What a confession of weakness and race 
	      prejudice in high places! Thus the Negro 
	      population of Washington, refused the protection 
	      of white policemen and denied that 
	      of their own policemen, were thrown upon 
	      their own resources for the protection of 
	      their lives and homes. And how nobly and 
	      effectively they responded to this necessity 
	      is now a matter of proud record. Again we 
	      quote the white press:</p>

	      <quote>"While in the minor disorders of 
	      Saturday and Monday night
	      crowds of white men assumed the 
	      aggressive, the latest rioting was 
	      marked by a general preparedness 
	      on the part of colored men, who 
	      <pb n="4" />
	      during the day purchased hundreds 
	      of revolvers. They formed 
	      into crowds in their own sections 
	      and attacked white men wherever
	      found."</quote>

	      <p>But with action on the part of the Negro
	      to defend his home and life against the 
	      wanton attacks of white mobs, the situation 
	      underwent a rapid change. The white 
	      police threw off its neutrality and we read 
	      such headlines in the Metropolitan dailies 
	      as:</p>

	      <p>"Capital Police and Negroes in Many 
	      Battles; Three Are Dead."</p>

	      <p>And then, with the situation beyond control 
	      of the local police, came military intervention 
	      and the despatch of white soldiers 
	      to Washington by order of the Secretary 
	      of War, who took action after a conference 
	      with the President, and the appearance in 
	      the Metropolitan dailies of such headlines 
	      as:</p>

	      <p>"5 Dead in Capital Race Riots; U. S. 
	      Cavalry Fail to Stop Negroes."</p>
	      
	      <p>Thus establishing the fact that, while 
	      in Washington riotous outbreaks had occurred 
	      between two groups of American 
	      citizens, it was only against the mobs of 
	      one group that the United States troops 
	      were used.</p>

	      <p>But even the United States regulars
	      seemed to have been unable to stop the 
	      long-suffering worm that at last had turned 
	      upon its persecutors; and Negroes, at first 
	      quiescent, later on the defensive, were now 
	      on the aggressive in true "Hell Fighters" 
	      style, and were carrying the war into "the 
	      enemy's country," speeding through the 
	      streets of the white quarters in improvised 
	      tanks and leaving deadly leaden souvenirs 
	      behind:</p>

	      <p>"Numbers of Negroes took possession 
	      of high-powered automobiles in which they 
	      raced through the streets, pumping bullets 
	      from automatic weapons at all whites who 
	      happened without range. It is believed that 
	      numerous casualties resulting from this 
	      indiscriminate firing have not been reported 
	      to the police.</p>

	      <p>"Pennsylvania Avenue, the main thoroughfare, 
	      was thronged all night with 
	      crowds of both whites and Negroes. 
	      Wherever they met there was a clash. 
	      Shots were exchanged and razors flashed. 
	      Negroes, defying the whites, are touring 
	      the Northwest section of the city and daring 
	      any white man or woman to leave their 
	      homes. Many shots have been fired at 
	      windows in which a white face was seen.</p>

	      <p>"Apparently fearless of the shining 
	      bayonets of the United States forces, the 
	      Negroes organized a fleet of improvised 
	      tanks and started out to clean up the town. 
	      Practically all of them were armed. Many 
	      of the automobiles contained a surplus 
	      supply of sawed off shotguns loaded with 
	      heavy charges and buckshot."</p>
	      
	      <p>And not only did the Negroes of the Capital 
	      fight back, and fight back with a vengeance, 
	      but the colored people in several 
	      near-by towns across the Maryland border 
	      organized and began to move upon the 
	      Capital to the aid of their brethren, and 
	      were only prevented from taking a hand 
	      in the Washington eruption by the quick 
	      action of the War Department which despatched 
	      a large force of the United States 
	      regulars to block their way to the Capital.</p>
	    </div>

	    <div>
	      <head>The Chicago Riot</head>
	      <p>Ill-feeling of long standing between the 
	      two races in Chicago was the underlying 
	      cause of the outbreak which, however, was 
	      undoubtedly precipitated by the Washington 
	      troubles. One of the chief reasons of 
	      <pb n="5" />
	      racial antagonism in Chicago was the rapid 
	      growth of the Negro population, its 
	      increasing competition in the labor market 
	      and its invasion of white neighborhoods.</p>

	      <p>The Chicago Negroes, having digested 
	      the lesson of the Washington riots when 
	      the white police stood by in benevolent neutrality 
	      to white mobs, fought back from the 
	      start. They, too, carried the war into "the 
	      enemy's territory," though in greater 
	      numerical inferiority than were the Washington 
	      Negroes. They, too, demonstrated that 
	      they had learnt a good many things by their 
	      participation in the White Man's War of 
	      1914-1919. One of their first acts being 
	      the storming and rifling of an armory and 
	      the cutting of the telephone wires in the 
	      "war area."</p>

	      <p>While, as said before, the two outbreaks 
	      were alike in their salient features, Chicago
	      was saved the disgraceful spectacle of the 
	      authorities truckling to the white mobs by 
	      detaching from duty her colored policemen. 
	      She escaped the stigma, too, of inciting to 
	      riot by her white press. Apart from this, 
	      however, the white mobs of Chicago have 
	      nothing to be proud of. Like the white 
	      mobs in Washington they were bravest in 
	      their attacks on lone Negroes, and in the 
	      instances when they cornered a lone and 
	      unarmed Negro they descended to barbarities 
	      that the Washington whites have not 
	      been, as yet, accused of. The New York 
	      Call of August first, reports, with photographs, 
	      one of the instances as follows:</p>

	      <p>"This mob has cornered a Negro under 
	      an outside stairway near 46th street and 
	      Wentworth avenue. The men who 'got' 
	      him are in the right of the picture just 
	      running to join the group about the stairway.</p>
	      
	      <p>"And at the right is the dying Negro and 
	      the pair who were 'in at the death.' The 
	      arm of the one in the cap is still upraised. 
	      He has just thrown his last stone."</p>

	      <p>Another lone Negro cornered in a white 
	      section was burned to death. And to such 
	      barbarities did the white mobs of Chicago 
	      descend that the Mayor of the second American 
	      city (to whom by the way all honor 
	      for his stand against turning the militia 
	      loose) gives as his reason for finally calling 
	      upon Governor Lowden for troops the fact 
	      that he was in receipt of authentic information 
	      that an attempt would be made to 
	      burn down the "Black Belt" with a duplication 
	      of the East St. Louis horrors:</p>

	      <p>"Information was accurate, and I was 
	      satisfied it was well founded," the Mayor 
	      said. "The condition of the buildings was 
	      so dry that conflagration might have 
	      started in no time. As evidence of the 
	      absolute authenticity of my information, I 
	      am having prepared a list of the fires and 
	      alarms last night."</p>
	    </div>

	    <div>
	      <head>Comment</head>

	      <p>Naturally two race riots of such extent
	      excited considerable comment from the 
	      press and leading men of the nation. The 
	      New York Call and the New York World 
	      were outspoken in their denunciations of 
	      the white injustices which both recognized 
	      to be the underlying cause; the New York 
	      Globe joined in denouncing white injustice 
	      and the wanton attack upon Negro lives but 
	      nevertheless was of the opinion that Negroes 
	      never, never should resort to force; 
	      and Arthur Brisbane, in the New York 
	      American, while engaging in no denunciation 
	      that we have seen or heard of, proffered 
	      the advice that Negroes would do 
	      well not to resort to force as "The odds 
	      are too greater in number and in ability. 
	      Besides, real force resides in Government 
	      and this entire Government is white."

	      The only word from the white "Christian 
	      Church" was uttered by Cardinal Gibbons, 
	      who, not deigning to denounce the injustices 
	      to which the Negro is subjected, 
	      showed more interest in booze than in 
	      human lives and saw in the riots only proof
	      "that a legislative suppression of intoxicating 
	      drinks is not, as it was said to be, a 
	      panacea against all social and moral evils," 
	      which comment he supplemented with 
	      some drivel to the effect that capitalism was 
	      Labor's best friend.</p>

	      <p>Among such papers as The New York 
	      Times, the riots were attributed to the 
	      growth of Bolshevism among Negroes and 
	      not to any injustice in the white man's 
	      attitude and treatment of the Negro.</p>

	      <p>The ubiquitous Lusk Committee, too, 
	      had its fling by the dissemination of the 
	      opinion of one Ven Svare, a Cleveland 
	      lawyer, whose testimony before the Stone 
	      Agers included the statement that:</p>

	      <p>"The Bolsheviki had a bad habit of 
	      getting hold of armored cars and running 
	      them through the streets of Petrograd and 
	      carrying on disorderly shooting, and when 
	      I read recently about he way some of the 
	      Negroes were behaving down at Washington 
	      it reminded me very much of the Bolshevist 
	      tactics of the same kind in Petrograd."</p>
	      
	      <p>Not that Negroes who are determined to defend 
	      their lives and homes against wanton and lawless 
	      attacks will have any 
	      objections to being called Bolshevists for so 
	      doing, but it is an interesting phase of a 
	      <pb n="6" />
	      serious situation and further proof of the 
	      hypocrisy and casuistry of the caucasian 
	      that he should feel called upon to frame 
	      up causes and excuses to explain two outbreaks 
	      that were acknowledgedly started 
	      by white mobs and in which colored men 
	      and women merely fought in defence of 
	      their lives and homes. Is the white man, 
	      already morally bankrupt, approaching 
	      intellectual bankruptcy?</p>

	    <p>America won the war that was alleged to be 
	    fought for the purpose of making the world safe 
	    for democracy, but in the light of recent happenings 
	    in Washington, the Capital city, and Chicago, 
	    it would seem as though the United States is not 
	    a part of the world. In order to win the war 
	    President Wilson employed "force, unstinted force" 
	    and those who expect to bring any similar desirable 
	    termination to a just cause can do no less than 
	    follow the splendid example set them by the reputed 
	    spokesman of humanity. That the lesson did 
	    not take long to penetrate the minds of Negroes is 
	    demonstrated by the change that has taken place 
	    in their demeanor and tactics. No longer are Negroes 
	    willing to be shot down or hunted from place 
	    to place like wild beasts; no longer will they flee 
	    from their homes and leave their property to the 
	    tender mercies of the howling and cowardly mob. 
	    They have changed, and now they intend to give 
	    men's account of themselves. If death is to be 
	    their portion, New Negroes are determined to make 
	    their dying a costly investment for all concerned. 
	    If they must die they are determined that they 
	    shall not travel through the valley of the shadow 
	    of death alone, but that some of their oppressors 
	    shall be their companions.</p>
	    
	    <p>This new spirit is but a reflex of the great war, 
	    and it is largely due to the insistent and vigorous 
	    agitation carried on by younger men of the race. 
	    The demand is uncompromisingly made for either 
	    liberty or death, and since death is likely to be a 
	    two-edged sword it will be to the advantage of 
	    those in a position to do so to give the race its 
	    long-denied liberty.</p>

	    <p>The new spirit animating Negroes is not confined 
	    to the United States, where it is most acutely 
	    manifested, but is simmering beneath the surface 
	    in every country where the race is oppressed. The 
	    Washington and Chicago outbreaks should be 
	    regarded as symptoms of a great pandemic, and the 
	    Negroes as courageous surgeons who performed the 
	    necessary though painful operation. That the remedy 
	    is efficacious is beyond question. It has 
	    brought results, for as a consequence the eyes of 
	    the entire world are focused upon the racial situation 
	    in the United States. The world knows now 
	    that the New Negroes are determined to observe 
	    the primal law of self-preservation whenever civil 
	    laws break down; to assist the authorities to preserve 
	    order and prevent themselves and families 
	    from being murdered in cold blood. Surely, no 
	    one can sincerely object to this new and laudable 
	    determination. Justification for this course is not 
	    lacking, for it is the white man's own Bible that 
	    says "Those who live by the sword shall perish by 
	    the sword," and since white men believe in force, 
	    Negroes who have mimicked them for nearly three 
	    centuries must copy them in this respect. Since 
	    fire must be fought with hell fire, and diamond 
	    alone can cut diamond, Negroes realize that force 
	    alone is an effective medium to counteract force. 
	    Counter irritants are useful in curing diseases, and 
	    Negroes are being driven by their white fellow 
	    citizens to investigate the curative values inherent 
	    in mass action, revolvers and other lethal devices 
	    when applied to social diseases.</p>

	    <p>The New Negro has arrived with stiffened back 
	    bone, dauntless manhood, defiant eye, steady hand 
	    and a will or iron. His creed is admirably summed 
	    up in the poem of Claude McKay, the black Jamaican 
	    poet, who is carving out for himself a niche in 
	    the Hall of Fame:</p>

	    <p>Though the poem is the production of a West Indian negro, a native 
	    of Jamaica, it nevertheless reflects the conviction of a large group of 
	    American citizens of African descentâ€”a group who felt that death is 
	    preferable to a state halfway between slavery and freedom. This group 
	    has sworn by the blood of their kinsmen who fell on the battle fields 
	    of France, in a death grip with the foe, to help make the world safe 
	    for democracy, that they will no longer tamely submit to a denial 
	    of the rights guaranteed them by the National Constitution.</p>

	    <p>This does not mean that they intend to go around with a chip on 
	    the shoulder seeking for trouble; that they mean to be needlessly 
	    offensive; that they will provoke a conflict, or that they intend to 
	    resort to force to secure a fair measure of righteous justice. Not at 
	    all. It means that they will pursue the path of peace, imposing on 
	    themselves the virtue of self-restraint to the limit, impelled by the 
	    lofty purpose to agitate for a better understanding between the races. 
	    They will demand a hearing at the bar of public opinion.</p>

	    <p>It is quite certain, however, that the fulminating of the archaic 
	    and vicious dogma, "This is a white man's country," which of late 
	    has been resurrected, will not conduce to a better understanding between 
	    the races. Moreover, when Gen. Lee surrendered his sword to 
	    the commander of the triumphant armies of freedom at Appomattox, 
	    that dogma fell a shattered idol.</p>

	    <p>This year is the ter-centenary of the coming of our forebears to this 
	    country, which antedates by a year the coming of the Pilgrim Fathers. 
	    Our claim to an equitable ownership of this country is attested by 
	    three centuries of toil for its development and expansion, as well as 
	    by heroic deeds and sacrifices in its defense on fields of sanguinary 
	    conflict from Bunker Hill to Metz. We are here, and here to stayâ€”not 
	    as aliens or pariahs but as a bona fide and integral part of the body 
	    politic. Our supreme desire is to be allowed to exercise our inalienable 
	    rights without let or hindrance, to prove a strong prop in the support 
	    of American institutions, and to continue a helpful factor in the development 
	    of American industry.</p>

	    <p>We most earnestly pray the Congress to make diligent inquiry as to 
	    the underlying cause of the race riots at Washington, D.C., Chicago, 
	    Ill., and Knoxville, Tenn., with the view of formulating such suggestions
	    for adoption by the people as, in your judgment, may prove a 
	    safeguard against similar outbreaks in the future, and also had lead to 
	    the establishment of a more friendly relationship between the races.</p>

	    <p>And you petitioners will ever pray.</p>

	    <p>The author of these poems is a native of Jamaica, where he was born in 1889, and where 
	    he lived till 1911, publishing a book of dialect verse already referred to in our columns. 
	    After reaching the United States he worked his way through Kansas to the West in various 
	    capacities, and gained experience which has not been without effect on the subject matter of his 
	    poetry. For a while he stayed at the Kansas Agricultural College, where the opportunity 
	    presented itself of studying 'literary English.' The fact that this is for Mr. McKay partly an 
	    acquired language adds considerably to the interest of his work. Here can be found some of those 
	    peculiar qualities which rendered the visit of the Southern Syncopated Orchestra so memorable 
	    last autumn, and for which we are becoming accustomed to look as the distinctive contribution 
	    of African Art in general.</p>

	    <p>The writer of these verses was born in the Clarendon 
	    Hills of Jamaica in 1889. In 1911 he published a small 
	    volume in the Negro dialect, and later left for the United 
	    States where he worked in various occupations and took 
	    courses in Agriculture and English at the Kansas State 
	    College. In the spring of this year he visited England to 
	    arrange for the publication of his poems.</p>

	    <p>Claude McKay is a pure blooded Negro<note type="editorial">McKay was born in Jamaica.</note>, and though 
	    we have recently been made aware of some of the more 
	    remarkable achievements of African Art typified by the 
	    sculpture from Benin, and in music by the 'Spirituals,' 
	    this is the first instance of success in poetry with which 
	    we in Europe at any rate have been brought into contact. 
	    The reasons for this late development are not far to seek, 
	    and the difficulties presented by modern literary English 
	    as an acquired medium would be sufficient to account for 
	    the lacuna; but the poems here selected may, in the 
	    opinion of not a few who have seen them in periodical 
	    form, claim a place beside the best work that the present 
	    generation is producing in this country.</p>

	    <p>But the group of the new Negro poets, whose work 
	    makes up the bulk of this anthology, contains names 
	    destined to be known. Claude McKay, although still 
	    quite a young man, has already demonstrated his power, 
	    breadth and skill as a poet. Mr. McKay's breadth 
	    is as essential a part of his equipment as his power and
	    skill as a poet. He demonstrates a mastery of the three when as a 
	    Negro poet he pours out the bitterness and rebellion in 
	    his heart in those two sonnet-tragedies, <ref target="#if-we-must-die">"If We Must 
	    Die"</ref> and <ref target="#supp_mckay_to-the-white-fiends">"To the White Fiends,"</ref> in a manner that 
	    strikes terror; and when as a cosmic poet he creates the 
	    atmosphere and mood of poetic beauty in the absolute, 
	    as he does in <ref target="#spring-in-new-hampshire">"Spring in New Hampshire"</ref> and <ref target="#the-harlem-dancer">"The 
	    Harlem Dancer."</ref> Mr. McKay gives evidence that he 
	    has passed beyond the danger which threatens many of 
	    the new Negro poetsâ€”the danger of allowing the purely 
	    polemical phases of the race problem to choke their sense 
	    of artistry.</p>
	    <p>Mr. McKay's earliest work is unknown in country. 
	    It consists of poems written and published in his 
	    native Jamaica. I was fortunate enough to run across 
	    this first volume, and I could not refrain from reproducing 
	    here one of the poems written in the West 
	    Indian Negro dialect. I have done this not only to 
	    illustrate the widest range of the poet's talent and to 
	    <pb n="xliv" />
	    offer a comparison between the American and the West 
	    Indian dialects, but on account of the intrinsic worth 
	    of the poem itself. I was much tempted to introduce 
	    several more, in spite of the fact that they might require 
	    a glossary, because however greater Mr. McKay 
	    may do he can do anything more touching and 
	    charming than these poems in the Jamaica dialect.</p>
