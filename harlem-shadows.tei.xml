		  <quote>
		    Since Dunbar, no Negro singer has interpreted Negro sentiment and emotion with a poetic realism to equal Claude McKay's. Of purest African blood, he shows us in "Harlem Shadows" not only the America of his youth and the Jamaica of his childhood, but the Africa of his forbears—and how he feels toward each. There is a world of relevation in these.

            <head>Introduction</head>

	    <p>These poems have a special interest for all the 
	    races of man because they are sung by a pure 
	    blooded Negro. They are the first significant 
	    expression of that race in poetry. We tried 
	    faithfully to give a position in our literature to 
	    Paul Laurence Dunbar. We have excessively 
	    welcomed other black poets of minor talent, seeking 
	    in their music some distinctive quality other 
	    than the fact that they wrote it. But here for 
	    the first time we find our literature vividly enriched
	    by a voice from this most alien race 
	    among us. And it should be illuminating to 
	    observe that while these poems are characteristic 
	    of that race as we most admire it—they are 
	    gentle-simple, candid, brave and friendly, quick 
	    of laughter and of tears—yet they are still more 
	    characteristic of what is deep and universal in 
	    mankind. There is no special or exotic kind of 
	    merit in them, no quality that demands a transmutation 
	    of our own natures to perceive. Just 
	    as the sculptures and wood and ivory carvings of <pb n="x"/>
	    the vast forgotten African Empires of Ifé and 
	    Benin, although so wistful in their tranquillity
	    are tranquil in the possession of the qualities of 
	    all classic and great art, so these poems, the 
	    purest of them, move with a sovereignty that is 
	    never new to the lovers of the high music of 
	    human utterance.</p>

	    <p>It is the peculiarity of his experience, rather 
	    than of his nature, that makes this poet's race a 
	    fact to be remembered in the enjoyment of his 
	    songs. The subject of all poetry is the experience 
	    of the poet, and no man of any other race in the 
	    world can touch or imagine the experience of the 
	    children of African slaves in America.</p>

	    <p>Claude McKay was born in 1890 in a little 
	    thatched house of two rooms in a beautiful valley 
	    of the hilly middle-country of Jamaica. He 
	    was born to the genial, warm, patient, neighborly 
	    farmer's life of that island. It was a life 
	    rich in sun and sound and color and emotion, as 
	    we can see in his poems which are forever 
	    homeward yearning—in the midst of their present 
	    passion and strong will into the future, forever 
	    vividly remembering. Like a blue-bird's note in 
	    a March wind, those sudden clear thoughts of <pb n="xi"/>
	    the warm South ring out in the midst of his northern 
	    songs. They carry a thrill into the depth 
	    of our hearts. Perhaps in some sense they are 
	    thoughts of a mother. At least it seems inevitable 
	    that we should find among them those 
	    two sacred sonnets of a child's bereavement. It 
	    seems inevitable that a wonderful poet should 
	    have had a wise and beautiful mother.</p>

	    <p>We can only distantly imagine how the happy 
	    tropic life of play and affection, became shadowed 
	    and somber for this sensitive boy as he grew, 
	    by a sense of the subjection of his people, 
	    and the memory of their bondage to an alien 
	    race. Indeed the memory of Claude McKay's 
	    family goes back on his mother's side beyond 
	    the days of bondage, to a time in Madagascar 
	    when they were still free, and by the grace of 
	    God still "savage." He learned in early childhood 
	    the story of their violent abduction, and 
	    how they were freighted over the seas in ships, 
	    and sold at public auction in Jamaica. He learned 
	    another story, too, which must have kindled a 
	    fire that slept in his blood—a story of the rebellion 
	    of the members of his own family at the 
	    auction-block. A death-strike, we should call it <pb n="xii" />
	    now—for they agreed that if they were divided 
	    and sold away into different parts of the country 
	    they would all kill themselves. And this fact 
	    solemnly announced in the market by the oldest 
	    white-haired Negro among them, had such an 
	    effect upon prospective buyers that it was impossible 
	    to sell them as individuals, and so they were 
	    all taken away together to those hills at Clarendon 
	    which their descendants still cultivate. With the 
	    blood of these rebels in his veins, and their memory 
	    to stir it, we cannot wonder that Claude 
	    McKay's earliest boyish songs in the Jamaica dialect 
	    were full of heresy and the militant love of 
	    freedom, and that his first poem of political significance 
	    should have been a rally-call to the 
	    street-car men on strike in Kingston. He found 
	    himself by an instinctive gravitation singing in 
	    the forefront of the battle for human liberty. A 
	    wider experience and a man's comprehension of 
	    the science of history has only strengthened his 
	    voice and his resolution.</p>

	    <p>Those early songs and the music he composed 
	    for them, were very popular in Jamaica. Claude 
	    McKay was quite the literary prince of the island 
	    for a time—a kind of Robert Burns among his <pb n="xiii"/>
	    own people, as we can imagine, with his physical 
	    beauty, his quick sympathy, and the magnetic 
	    wayward humor of his ways. He received in 
	    1912 the medal of the Institute of Arts and 
	    Sciences in recognition of his preëminence. He 
	    was the first Negro to receive this medal, and 
	    he was the first poet who ever made songs in the 
	    quaint haunting dialect of the island. But nevertheless 
	    it was not until he came to the United 
	    States that Claude McKay began to confront 
	    the deepest feelings in his heart, and realize that 
	    a delicate syllabic music could not alone express 
	    them. Here his imagination awoke, and the 
	    colored imagery that is the language of all deep 
	    passion began to appear in his poetry. Here 
	    too he conceived and felt the history and position 
	    of his people with mature poetic force. He knew 
	    that his voice belonged not only to his own moods 
	    and the general experience of humanity, but to 
	    the hopes and sorrows of his race.</p>

	    <p>A great many foolish things are said even by 
	    wise people upon the subject of racial inferiority. 
	    They seem to think that if science could 
	    establish a certain difference of average ability 
	    as between the whites and blacks, that would <pb n="xiv"/> 
	    justify them in placing the whole of one of these 
	    races in a position of inferior esteem. The same 
	    fallacy is committed in the discussions of sex-inferiority, 
	    and it is worth while to make clear 
	    the perfect folly of it. If any defined quantitative 
	    difference is ever established between the 
	    average abilities of such groups, it will be a 
	    relatively slight one. The difficulty of establishing 
	    it, is a proof of that. And a slight difference 
	    in the general average would have no application 
	    whatever as between any two individuals, or any 
	    minor groups of individuals. The enormous majority 
	    of both races, as of both sexes, would show 
	    the same degree of ability. And so great is the 
	    factor of individual variation that we could not 
	    even be sure an example of the highest ability 
	    might not arise in the group whose average was 
	    "inferior." This simple consideration of fact and 
	    good logic should suffice to silence those who 
	    think they can ever appeal to science in support 
	    of a general race or sex prejudice.</p>

	    <p>But in so far as the problem arises between a 
	    dominant and a subjected race, it is impossible 
	    for science to say anything even as to averages. 
	    For a fair general test is impossible. The children <pb n="xv" />
	    of the subjected race never have a chance. 
	    To be deprived at the very dawn of selfhood of 
	    a sense of possible superiority, is to be undernourished 
	    at the point of chief educative importance. 
	    And to be assailed in early childhood with 
	    a pervading intimation of inferiority is poison in 
	    the very centers of growth. Except for people of 
	    the highest force of character, therefore, to be 
	    born into a subjected race is to grow up inferior, 
	    not only to the other race, but to one's own potential 
	    self. We see an example of this kind of 
	    growth in the bombastic locutions of the traditional 
	    "darkie" who has acquired a little culture. 
	    Those great big words and long sentences are the 
	    result of a feeling of inferiority. They are a 
	    pathetic over-correction of the very quality of 
	    simple-heartedness which is carried so high in 
	    these poems of Claude McKay. It is carried so 
	    high, and made so boldly beautiful, that we can 
	    not withhold a tribute to his will, as well as to 
	    his music and imagination. The naked force of 
	    character that we feel in those two recent sonnets, 
	    "Baptism" and "The White City," is no 
	    mere verbal semblance. Its reality is certified by 
	    the very achievement of such commanding art <pb n="xvi" /> 
	    in the face of a contemptuous or condescending 
	    civilization.</p>

	    <p>Claude McKay came to the United States in 
	    1912, having been offered an education here by 
	    a friend in Jamaica who believed in his abilities. 
	    His intention was to learn scientific farming, and 
	    return to the island to offer practical wisdom as 
	    well as music to his people. He went at first to 
	    one of our established philanthropic institutions 
	    for the training of colored people. He stayed 
	    there a few months—long enough to weary of 
	    the almost military system of discipline. And 
	    then he went to the Agricultural College of 
	    Kansas, where he had learned that a free life 
	    and a more elective system of education prevailed. 
	    He studied for two years there, thinking continually 
	    less about farming and more about literature, 
	    and gradually losing away altogether the 
	    idea of returning to live in Jamaica. He left the 
	    college in 1914, knowing that he was a poet—and 
	    imagining, I think, that he was a rather irresponsible 
	    and wayward character—to cast in his lot 
	    with the working-class Negroes of the north. 
	    Since then he has earned his living in every 
	    one of the ways that the northern Negroes do, <pb n="xvii"/>
	    from "pot-wrestling" in a boarding-house kitchen 
	    to dining-car service on the New York and Philadelphia 
	    Express. But like all true poets, he failed 
	    to take the duty of "earning a living" very seriously. 
	    It was a matter of collecting enough money 
	    from each new job to quit for a while and live. 
	    And with each period of living a new and a more 
	    sure and beautiful song would come out of him.</p>

	    <p>The growth of beauty and sureness in these 
	    songs would be apparent if they were arranged 
	    in the order of their creation. As it is, the 
	    reader will observe occasional lapses of quality. 
	    One or two of the rhythms I confess I am not 
	    able to apprehend at all. Perhaps they will be 
	    picked up by receivers who are attuned to a different 
	    wave-length. But the quality is here in 
	    them all—the pure, clear arrow-like transference 
	    of his emotion into our breast, without any but 
	    the inevitable words—the quality that reminds us 
	    of Burns and Villon and Catullus, and all the 
	    poets that we call lyric because we love them so 
	    much. It is the quality that Keats sought to 
	    cherish when he said that "Poetry should be 
	    great and unobtrusive, a thing which enters into 
	    the soul, and does not startle or amaze with <pb n="xviii"/> 
	    itself but with its subject." Poetry with this 
	    quality is not for those whose interest is mainly 
	    in the manufacture of poems. It will come rather 
	    to those whose interest is in the life of things. 
	    It is the poetry of life, and not of the poet's 
	    chamber. It is the poetry that looks upon a 
	    thing, and sings. It is possessed by a feeling and 
	    sings. May it find its way a little quietly and 
	    softly, in this age of roar and advertising, to the 
	    hearts that love a true and unaffected song.</p>

	  <div type="introductory-prose" xml:id="authors-word">
	    <head>Author's Word</head> 

	    <p>In putting ideas and feelings into poetry, I have 
	    tried in each case to use the medium most 
	    adaptable to the specific purpose. I own allegiance 
	    to no master. I have never found it possible 
	    to accept in entirety any one poet. But I 
	    have loved and joyed in what I consider the finest 
	    in the poets of all ages.</p>

	    <p>The speech of my childhood and early youth 
	    was the Jamaica Negro dialect, the native variant 
	    of English, which still preserves a few words of 
	    African origin, and which is more difficult of 
	    understanding than the American Negro dialect. 
	    But the language we wrote and read in school 
	    was England's English. Our text books then, 
	    before the advent of the American and Jamaican 
	    readers and our teachers, too, were all English-made. 
	    The native teachers of the elementary 
	    schools were tutored by men and women of British 
	    import. I quite remember making up verses in 
	    the dialect and in English for our moonlight ring <pb n="xx" />
	    dances and for our school parties. Of our purely 
	    native songs the jammas (field and road), shay-shays 
	    (yard and booth), wakes (post-mortem), 
	    Anancy tales (transplanted African folk lore), 
	    and revivals (religious) are all singularly punctuated 
	    by meter and rhyme. And nearly all my 
	    own poetic thought has always run naturally into 
	    these regular forms.</p>

	    <p>Consequently, although very conscious of the 
	    new criticisms and trends in poetry, to which I 
	    am keenly responsive and receptive, I have adhered 
	    to such of the older traditions as I find 
	    adequate for my most lawless and revolutionary 
	    passions and moods. I have not used patterns, 
	    images and words that would stamp me a 
	    classicist nor a modernist. My intellect is not 
	    scientific enough to range me on the side of 
	    either; nor is my knowledge wide enough for me 
	    to specialize in any school.</p>

	    <p>I have never studied poetics; but the forms 
	    I have used I am convinced are the ones I can 
	    work in with the highest degree of spontaneity 
	    and freedom.</p>

	    <p>I have chosen my melodies and rhythms by 
	    instinct, and I have favored words and figures <pb n="xxi" />
	    which flow smoothly and harmoniously into my 
	    compositions. And in all my moods I have 
	    striven to achieve directness, truthfulness and 
	    naturalness of expression instead of an enameled 
	    originality. I have not hesitated to use words 
	    which are old, and in some circles considered 
	    poetically overworked and dead, when I thought 
	    I could make them glow alive by new manipulation. 
	    Nor have I stinted my senses of the pleasure 
	    of using the decorative metaphor where it is 
	    more truly and vividly beautiful than the exact 
	    phrase. But for me there is more quiet delight 
	    in "The golden moon of heaven" than in "The 
	    terra-cotta disc of cloud-land."</p>

	    <p>Finally, while I have welcomed criticism, 
	    friendly and unfriendly, and listened with willing 
	    attention to many varying opinions concerning 
	    other poems and my own, I have always, in the 
	    summing up, fallen back on my own ear and 
	    taste as the arbiter.</p>

	      <p>"If We Must Die" is surely McKay's most famous poem. He recounts its origin in <title level="m">A Long Way From Home</title>:</p>
	      <cit>
		<quote>
		  <p>Among my new poems there was a sonnet entitled "If We Must Die." It was the most recent of all. Great events had occurred between the time when I had first met Frank Harris and my meeting with Max Eastman. The World War had ended. But its end was a sign for the outbreak of little wars between labor and capital and, like a plague breaking out in sore places, between colored folk and white.</p>
		  <p>Our Negro newspapers were morbid, full of details of clashes between colored and white, murderous shootings and hangings. Traveling from city to city and unable to guage the attitude and temper of each one, we Negro railroad men were nervous. We were less light-hearted. We did not separate from one another gaily to spend ourselves in speakeasies and gambling joints. We stuck together, some of us armed, going from the railroad station to our quarters. We stayed in our quarters all through the dreary ominous nights, for we never knew what was going to happen.</p>
		  <p>It was during those days that the sonnet, "If We Must Die," exploded our of me. And for it the Negro people unanimously hailed me as a poet. Indeed, that one grand outburst is their sole standard of appraising my poetry. It was the only poem I ever read to the members of my crew.</p>

	      <p>In his autobiography, McKay also describes the strong desire that Frank Harris, editor of <title level='j'>Pearson's</title>, had to publish the poem; McKay, however, had already committed to publishing the poem in <title level='j'>The Liberator</title>, edited by Max Eastman:</p>
	      <quote><p>I was keen about the poem appearing in <title level='j'>The Liberator</title>, because of that magazine's high literary and social standard. Although I esteemed Frank Harris as a great critic, <title level='j'>Pearson's</title> was <emph rend='italics'>his</emph> magazine only, a one man magazine, smashingly critical, daringly so about social problems, yet having no constructive social program. But <title level='j'>The Liberator</title> was a group magazine. The list of contributing editors was almost as exciting to read as the contributions themselves. There was freeness and a bright new beauty in those contributions, pictorial and literary, that thrilled. And altogether, in their entirety, they were implicit of a penetrating social criticism which did not in the least overshadow their novel and sheer artistry. I rejoiced in the thought of the honor of appearing among that group.</p></quote>

	      <p>McKay recorded this poem for the Folkways LP <title level='m'>Anthology of Negro Poetry</title> released in connection with Arna Bontemps's edited collection of the same title. McKay introduces the poem on that recording:</p>
	      <quote>
	      <p>"If We Must Die" is the poem that makes me a poet among colored Americans. Yet frankly, I have never regarded myself as a Negro poet. I have always felt that my gift of song was something bigger than the narrow confining limits of any one people and its problems. Even though many of my themes were racial, I wrote my poems to make a universal appeal. When "If We Must Die" was first published in 1919 it was denounced by many conservative white leaders as evidence of a new spirit among Negroes. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge read it into the records of Congress, but times change, and so I was not at all surprised when during the Nazi air blitz on Britain, an English anthologist requested the use of "If We Must Die" for an anthology of verse. But I was surprised by what happened when I turned on my radio one morning in 1944. A commentator was telling about the death of a young, white American soldier on the Russian front. The commentator went on to say that the youth was a lover of poetry and he proceeded to read one of five poems which had been discovered on the death youth's body. And he read "If We Must Die." The commentator did not mention the name of the author, Claude McKay, nor did he state that the poem was the work of a colored man. Perhaps he did not know. But I felt profoundly gratified and justified. I felt assurance that "If We Must Die" was just what I intended it to be, a universal poem. And wherever men are pressed, with their backs against the wall, abused, outraged, and murdered, whether they are minorities or nations, black or brown or yellow or white, Catholics or Protestants or Pagans, fighting against the terror, "If We Must Die" could be appropriately read.</p></quote>

	    <l>Worn out by the sharp struggle, fast asleep.</l>

	      <l>A Negro band, that scarcely seems awake,</l>

	      <l>While quick and willing boys their orders take</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">And hurry to and from the near saloon.</l>
	      <l>Then suddenly a happy, lilting note</l>

	      <l>Under the smoke upon foul air afloat;</l>

	      <l>No faith is theirs, no shining ray of hope,</l>

	      <l>But, oh! they dance with poetry in their eyes</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">Whose dreamy loveliness no sorrow dims,</l>
	      <l>And parted lips and eager, gleeful cries,</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">And perfect rhythm in their nimble limbs.</l>
	      <l rend="indent2">The gifts divine are theirs, music and laughter:</l>

	  <pb n="275" />

	  <p>The present revival of poetry in America 
	  could scarcely advance without 
	  carrying in its wake the impulse and practice 
	  of a poetic consciousness in the Negro race.</p>

	  <p>While we have no traditions in the art, 
	  we have a rich and precious tradition in 
	  the substance of poetry: vision, intense emotionalism, 
	  spiritual and mystical affinities, 
	  with both abstract and concrete experience, 
	  and a subtle natural sense of rhythmic 
	  values. All these are essential folk-qualities, 
	  primal virtues in the expression of 
	  impassioned experience, whether festive of 
	  ceremonial, in all the indigenous folk-literatures 
	  of the world. But when a race 
	  advances from primitive life and customs, 
	  or when the divisions of a particular race 
	  become sharply differentiated by learning 
	  and culture, and intercourse with other 
	  peoples with modes of culture more perfect in 
	  certain respects affects them, there is produced 
	  a standard of form in written and 
	  oral speech that becomes a characteristic 
	  of class co-racial consciousness. This standard 
	  becomes the medium of literary expression 
	  in which taste is the vital essence, 
	  and is opposed by the "vulgar tongue" of 
	  the "people" in which the vigorous and imaginative 
	  folk-ballads are recited, the communal 
	  chants of traditional custom and 
	  ritual dramatized, and national songs sung.</p>

	  <p>The survival of the vulgar tongue in modern 
	  times, where the influence of formal and 
	  conventional civilization has penetrated 
	  among primitive communities, is in dialect 
	  the attempt of the invaded, enslaved, and 
	  suppressed peoples, to imitate phonetically 
	  the speech of the dominant class or race. 
	  Dialect is, thus, not the corruption of the 
	  folk or tribal language, of the Frankish 
	  invaders of Gaul, of the Anglo-Saxon conquest 
	  of ancient Britain, of the absorption 
	  of the African savages—who be likened 
	  in every tribal respect to the Franks, 
	  Angles and Saxons—by America, but of 
	  the language of the Latins, the Britons, and 
	  the English.</p>

	  <p>Dialect may be employed as the <foreign rend="italics">langue 
	  d'oc</foreign> of Frédéric Mistral's Provençal poems, 
	  as a preserved tongue, the only adequate 
	  medium of rendering the psychology of character, 
	  and of describing the background of 
	  the people whose lives and experience are 
	  kept within the environment, where the 
	  dialect survives as the universal speech; or it 
	  may be employed as a special mark of emphasis
	  upon the peculiar characteristic and 
	  temperamental traits of a people whose 
	  action and experiences are given in contact 
	  and relationship with a dominant language, 
	  and are set in a literary fabric of which they 
	  are but one strand of many in the weaving.</p>

	  <p>I have gone to some length in the foregoing 
	  because the matter is of vital importance 
	  to those who regard the future accomplishment 
	  of the Negro in American literature. 
	  It holds, too, I think, the explanation 
	  of that gap which exists between the 
	  mysterious and anonymous period of the 
	  "Sorrow Songs"—vivid, intense poetry of 
	  a suffering, but eternally confident folk—and 
	  the advent of Paul Laurence Dunbar. 
	  The Negro poet as such, can be said to 
	  have inherited no poetic traditions which 
	  would make him a bi-national artist: that 
	  is to say, he had no precursors sufficient 
	  in numbers and of decided genius, the 
	  substance of whose song was racial, while the 
	  expression was national—the glorious and 
	  perfect instrument of English poetic art, 
	  which we know as the common possession 
	  of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, 
	  Keats, Shelley, Swinburne, Browning, 
	  Longfellow, Poe and Lowell.</p>

	  <p>This gap I postulate as a silent transition 
	  to a new order of imaginative and emotional 
	  racial utterance. Remember that 
	  here was a race of many tribes, members 
	  of which amounting to hundreds of thousands 
	  were stolen from their native homes, 
	  from their immemorial customs and traditions, 
	  which in many instances have been 
	  proven to be the traits of a highly organized 
	  primitive culture and social code, and 
	  forcibly held in a captivity that suppressed 
	  every virtue but work and every 
	  ideal but obedience. The struggle through 
	  two centuries under this unchristian suppression 
	  was toward the acquisition of a <pb n="276" />
	  new language which in all its unfamiliar 
	  and tortuous meanings had to be learned 
	  through the auditory sense, as the invaluable 
	  aids of reading and writing were denied; 
	  and it is little wonder that the earliest 
	  and latest folk utterance of these 
	  people was the collective yearning of sorrow, 
	  impassioned and symbolic, addressed 
	  to the one benign spirit their masters taught 
	  them from whom to seek love and mercy in 
	  a mystical hereafter as a compensation for 
	  their miserable existence on earth. It was 
	  the poetry of an ancient race passing 
	  through the throes of an enforced re-birth 
	  into the epoch of an alien and dominating 
	  civilization.</p>

	  <p>When it sought voice in Paul Laurence 
	  Dunbar, it did so with old memories and 
	  impulses; it was the finale, in a rather 
	  conscious manner, of centuries of spiritual 
	  isolation, of a detached brooding and yearning 
	  for self-realization in the universal 
	  human scale, and in a childish gayety in 
	  eating the fruits of a freedom so suddenly 
	  possessed and difficult to realize. Dunbar 
	  was the end of a régime, and not the beginning 
	  of a tradition, as most careless critics, 
	  both white and colored, seem to think. But 
	  his niche is secure because he made the 
	  effort to express himself, and clothe his 
	  material artistically; though he never ventured 
	  into the abstract intricacies and wrung 
	  from the elements of rhythmic principles 
	  the subtle and most haunting forms of expression. 
	  His work reflected chiefly the life 
	  of the Negro during the era of Reconstruction 
	  and just a little beyond, when the race 
	  was emerging from the illusion of freedom 
	  to the hard and bitter reality of how 
	  much ground still remained to be dishearteningly 
	  but persistently fought for before 
	  a moral and spiritual liberty, as well as 
	  a complete political freedom and social fraternity, 
	  was attained. When Mr. Howells said 
	  that Dunbar was the first poet of his 
	  race to express and interpret the life of 
	  his people lyrically, he told only a half-truth; 
	  what survives and attracts us in 
	  the poetry of Dunbar is the life of the 
	  Negro in the limited experience of a transitional 
	  period, the rather helpless and 
	  still subservient era of testing freedom, and 
	  adjusting in the mass a new condition of 
	  relationship to the social, economic, civil 
	  and spiritual fabric of American civilization. 
	  Behind all this was an awakening 
	  impulse, a burning and brooding aspiration, 
	  creeping like a smothered fire through 
	  the consciousness of the race, which broke occasionally 
	  in Dunbar as through the crevices 
	  of his spirit—notably the sonnet to "Robert 
	  Gould Shaw," the "Ode to Ethiopia," and a 
	  few other poems—but which he did not 
	  have the deep and indignant and impassioned 
	  vision, or the subtle and enchanting 
	  art to sustain.</p>

	  <p>Such a poet we did have in substance, 
	  though he chose to express himself in the 
	  rhythms of impassioned prose rather than 
	  the more restricted and formal rhythm of 
	  verse. But the fact is as solid as the earth 
	  itself, that Dr. DuBois in "The Souls of 
	  Black Folk" began a poetry tradition. 
	  This book has more profoundly affected the 
	  spiritual nature of the race than any other 
	  ever written in this country; and has more 
	  clearly revealed to the nation at large the 
	  true idealism and high aspiration of the 
	  American Negro; and the intellectual mind 
	  of the country accepted it as the humanistic 
	  doctrine by which on terms of equal economic, 
	  political and social endeavor the 
	  Negro was to work out his destiny as an 
	  American citizen—sharing pound for pound 
	  the weight of responsibility, enjoying the 
	  same indivisible measure of privilege in the 
	  American democracy.</p>

	  <p>It is only through the intense, passionate, 
	  spiritual idealism of such substance as 
	  makes "The Souls of Black Folk" such 
	  a quivering rhapsody of wrongs endured and 
	  hopes to be fulfilled that the poets of the 
	  race with compelling artistry can lift the 
	  Negro into the only full and complete nationalism 
	  he knows—that of the American 
	  democracy. "There is no difference between 
	  men;" declared G. Lowes Dickinson, the 
	  English Platonist, "wealth, position race or 
	  nationality, make no difference between 
	  men: it is only the growth of the soul." And 
	  the poets of a race give expression and reality 
	  to the soul of a people through whose 
	  eternal laws no unnatural impediments of 
	  injustices or wrongs can keep from <choice><sic>ascendency</sic><corr>ascendancy</corr></choice>
	  to the highest <choice><sic>fulfilment</sic><corr>fulfillment</corr></choice> and the 
	  fullest participation in ideal and eternal 
	  privileges of life.</p>

	  <p>I am not one who believes that a Negro 
	  writer of verse—or of fiction, for that matter—must 
	  think, feel or write racially to 
	  be a great artist; nor can he be distinctively 
	  labeled by the material he uses. This is a <pb n="277" />
	  fallacy too often expressed by critics to 
	  confirm the desired hypothesis that the 
	  Negro is humanly different in the scale of 
	  mankind, that even after some centuries of 
	  civilizing process in America, he is still 
	  nearer in his most cultivated class to the 
	  instincts of his ancestral forbears than any 
	  other of the conglomerate races who compose 
	  the citizenry of the Republic. In every 
	  race and nation there are primitives who 
	  retain and impulses of barbarism, more evident 
	  and prevalent among peoples of the 
	  Teutonic stock than among those of the 
	  Latin stock. But the Negro has absorbed, 
	  in his advanced class, just as the advanced 
	  class of any other peoples, the culture of 
	  the best civilizations in the world today, and 
	  in his imaginative and artistic expression 
	  he is universal. What I said about embodying 
	  racial aspirations and material does not 
	  alter this fact. All great artists are interracial 
	  and international in rendering in the 
	  medium of any particular art the fundamental 
	  passions and the primary instincts of 
	  humanity.</p>

	  <p>The promise of this I seem to detect in 
	  the spiritual voice of the Negro becoming 
	  articulate in the poets who are beginning 
	  to emerge from the background of the people. 
	  They are springing up around us 
	  everywhere, and it is the profound duty of 
	  the race to encourage and support them. 
	  There is power and beauty in this pristine 
	  utterance—wood notes wild that have 
	  scarcely yet been heard beyond the forest 
	  of their own dreams. But if we will cherish 
	  these with a responsive audience, one day, 
	  and not very long hence, we shall have a 
	  great chorus of these singers to glorify our 
	  souls and the soul of America.</p>

	  <p>These notes do not include all the poets 
	  who have published books within recent 
	  years; they are intended rather to indicate 
	  tendencies, which I regard as more important 
	  for the moment, and illustrated by the 
	  examples of representative work printed 
	  during the past year. Thus, such writers 
	  as the late James D. Corruthers, Edward 
	  Smyth Jones, George Reginald Margetson, 
	  and others, do not fall within the 
	  scope of this paper. Nor do these writers 
	  quite reach the artistic development of those 
	  I deal with, neither does Mr. Fenton Johnson, 
	  a young man already the author of 
	  three volumes, and whose recent work shows 
	  a rapid and steady progress. This question 
	  of equipment, of a thorough grounding 
	  in the technical elements of the science 
	  of versification, is the greatest handicap to
	  the progress of many contemporary writers 
	  of verse. It is the hard and laborious task 
	  of mastering the subtle and fluctuating 
	  rhythms of verse that the average individual 
	  tries to escape which produces such a mass 
	  of mediocre work, often choking and wasting 
	  the substance of a passionate and imaginative 
	  poetic spirit. It is difficult to impress 
	  upon such individuals that they must 
	  serve a jealous and consecrated apprenticeship 
	  to this divine mistress, and that ambition 
	  is but a humble offering upon the altar 
	  of her sacred mystical religion.</p>

	  <p>There are, however, three books recently 
	  published, which show not only a distinctive 
	  poetic quality, but also an artistic adequacy 
	  of expression and which promise 
	  the <choice><sic>fulfilment</sic><corr>fulfillment</corr></choice> of the Negro in poetry I 
	  have so confidently predicted for the future. 
	  Besides these books, I have in the past year 
	  come across single poems in the magazines 
	  by unknown writers confirming more specifically 
	  the rapid development of the higher 
	  poetic qualities that are manifesting themselves 
	  in the Negro. These latter I will deal 
	  with first, because they represent what I 
	  hope most to see accomplished; because they 
	  are the proofs of the contention that poets 
	  of the race may deal with a rich and original 
	  vein of racial material and give it the highest 
	  forms of creative literary expression, 
	  which neither differentiates the author from 
	  the artist in general nor tolerates for a moment 
	  the false psychology of that gratuitous, 
	  separate standard by which white critics are 
	  prone to judge the works of Negro authors.</p>

	  <p>The most significant accomplishment 
	  among these recent poems are two sonnets 
	  signed by "Eli Edwards" which appeared 
	  in <title level="j" rend="italic">The Seven Arts</title> for last October. "Eli 
	  Edwards," I understand, is the pseudonym 
	  of Claude McKay, who lives in New York 
	  City, choosing to conceal his identity as a 
	  poet from the associates among whom he 
	  works for his daily bread. His story as it 
	  is, which I had from Mr. Oppenheim, who 
	  accepted his poems when editor of <title level="j" rend="italic">The 
	  Seven Arts</title>, is full of alluring interest, and 
	  may one day be vividly featured as a 
	  topic of historic literary importance. For 
	  he may well be the keystone of the new 
	  movement in racial poetic achievement. Let 
	  me quote one of the sonnets: <pb n ="278" />
	  <quote source="#the-harlem-dancer">
	    <lg type="poem">
	      <head>The Harlem Dancer</head>
	      <l>Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">And watched her perfect, half-clothed body sway;</l>
	      <l>Her voice was like the sound of blended flutes</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">Blown by black players upon a picnic day.</l>
	      <l>She sang and danced on gracefully and calm,</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">The light gauze hanging loose about her form;</l>
	      <l>To me she seemed a proudly-swaying palm</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">Grown lovelier for passing through a storm.</l>
	      <l>Upon her swarthy neck black, shiny curls</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">Profusely fell; and, tossing coins in praise,</l>
	      <l>The wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys, and even the girls,</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">Devoured her with their eager, passionate gaze;</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">But, looking at her falsely-smiling face</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">I knew her self was not in that strange place.</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>
	  </p>

	  <p>Here, indeed, is the genuine gift—a vision 
	  that evokes from the confusing details of 
	  experience and brings into the picture the 
	  image in all its completeness of outline and 
	  its gradation of color, and rendered with 
	  that precise surety of form possessed by the 
	  resourceful artist. The power in this poet 
	  is, I think, his ability to reproduce a 
	  hectic scene of reality with all the solid 
	  accessories, as in "The Harlem Dancer," 
	  and yet make it float as it were upon a 
	  background of illusion through which comes 
	  piercing the glowing sense of a spiritual 
	  mystery. Note the exalted close of Mr. 
	  Edward's riotous picture of the dancer 
	  when

	  <quote>
	    <lg>
	      <l>. . . . looking at her falsely-smiling face,</l>
	      <l>I knew herself was not in that strange place—</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  he translates the significance of the intoxicated 
	  figure with its sensuous contagion 
	  into something ultimate behind the 
	  "falsely-smiling face," where "herself"—be 
	  it the innocent memory of childhood, perhaps 
	  of some pursuing dream of a brief 
	  happiness in love, or a far-away country 
	  home where her corybantic earnings secures 
	  in peace and comfort for the aged days of 
	  her parents—is inviolably wrapped in the 
	  innocence and beauty of her dreams. This 
	  sonnet differs in both visionary and artistic 
	  power from anything so far produced by 
	  the poets of the rate. The visual quality 
	  here possessed is extraordinary; not only 
	  does Mr. <sic>Edwards</sic> evoke his images with a 
	  clear and decisive imagination, but he 
	  throws at the same time upon the object 
	  the rich and warm colors his emotional 
	  sympathies.</p>

	      <l>Grown lovelier for passing through a storm.</l>
	      <l>Upon her swarthy neck black, shiny curls</l>
	      <l>Profusely fell; and, tossing coins in praise,</l>
	      <l>The wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys, and even the girls,</l>
	      <l>Devoured her with eager, passionate gaze:</l>
	      <l>But, looking at her falsely-smiling face,</l>

	  The whole <choice><sic>books</sic><corr>book</corr></choice> sounds a curiously wistful note, but the pathos

	      <l>The awful sin remained still unforgiven.</l>
	      <l>All night a bright and solitary star</l>
	      <l>(Perchance the one that ever guided him,</l>

	      <l>Hung pitifully o'er the swinging char.</l>
	      <l>Day dawned, and soon the mixed crowds came to view</l>
	      <l>The ghastly body swaying in the sun:</l>
	      <l>The women thronged to look, but never a one</l>
	      <l>Showed sorrow in her eyes of steely blue;</l>

	  Here is, indeed, the blot on the scutcheon of the United States.
	  There are, of course, two sides to the question, but, especially 
	  after reading Mr. McKay's poem, we do not feel that the other 
	  side needs supporting in quite the way he depicts.</p>

	  <p>The island of Jamaica has given us three Negroes who, along different lines, have risen 
	  into permanent prominence: Marcus Garvey, president of the Black Star Line and head 
	  of the most widely discussed movement in modern Negrodom; Joel A. Rogers, author 
	  of two books which stand without a peer in the output of Negro writing (<title level="m">From Superman
	  to Man</title> and <title level="m">As Nature Leads</title>); and Claude McKay, whose proud title to distinction 
	  consists of two simple words: The Poet. Mr. McKay began to write poetry before he left 
	  Jamaica, where he published three volumes of verse. Unfortunately (for us) his interest 
	  in his own fame is so slim that he did not take the trouble to preserve any copies of 
	  these earlier volumes, and we are left to speculate as to their quality.</p>

	  <p>Since he came to America Mr. McKay has worked at various jobs, depending firstly
	  on his hands to earn a living for himself. While on one of these jobs he was "discovered" 
	  by <title level="j">Pearson's Magazine</title> and Max Eastman's <title level="j">Liberator</title> of which he is at present associate 
	  editor. He has come to the fore by sheer virtue of the spiritual quality of poetic ability 
	  which no hardships could suppress. Without any aid from Negro editors or publications 
	  he made his way because white people who noted his gifts were eager to give him 
	  a chance while Negro editors, as usual, were either too blind to see or too mean-spirited 
	  to proclaim them to the world. His manly, stirring poem, <ref target='#if-we-must-die'>"If We Must Die,"</ref> first appeared 
	  in a white publication from which it was elevated to the dignity of a place in the 
	  <ref target="#supp_congressional-record"><title level="j">Congressional Record</title></ref>. It was then that the Negro reading public discovered him for 
	  themselves without any aid from their top-lofty mentors who are always "ready to bring 
	  forward young writers"—after they have been proclaimed by white critics.</p>

	  <p>Mr. McKay's slim little volume, <title level="m">Spring in New Hampshire and Other Poems</title>, which 
	  was published last year in London, is now before us. It reveals the author as a poet with 
	  a fine delicate technique and a curiously cultivated restraint. It is equally free from 
	  jingling and splurging and from the flaring fan-<choice><sic>tolds</sic><corr resp="cf" cert="low">folds</corr></choice> of the free-verse comedians who 
	  now hold the centre of the stage in that garish masquerade entitled "The New Poetry." 
	  The genuine breath of the tropics is felt in most of these poems, yet it seldom blows tornado 
	  blasts. The fine artistic feeling of the poet controls and tempers it to fine effects. 
	  Take, for instance, the last ten lines of "North and South":</p>

	  <quote source="#north-and-south">
	    <lg>
	      <l>A breadth of idleness is in the air</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">That casts a subtle spell upon all things,</l>
	      <l>And love and mating-time are every-where,</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">And wonder to life's commonplaces clings.</l>
	      <l>The fluttering humming-bird darts through the trees</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">And dips his long break in the big bell-flowers,</l>
	      <l>The leisured buzzard floats upon the breeze</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">Riding a crescent cloud for endless hours;</l>
	      <l>The sea beats softly on the emerald strands—</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">O sweet for dainty dreams are tropic lands!</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  <p>It would have been very easy to vulgarize such a theme, to indulge in what Amy Lowell 
	  calls "lazy writing," and to tread the common ground of commonplace figures. Instead, 
	  we find that the words and the measure create <choice><sic>and</sic><corr resp="cf" cert="low">an</corr></choice> appropriate tone-color (or 
	  "atmosphere") in which the scene is set, and the nuances make a something that is finer 
	  than melody. The fourth line of the quoted portion is the golden touch of genius.</p>

	  <p>Sometimes the hidden melody of his verse is so fine that those who think that poetry 
	  is compounded of jingles and junk will fail to find it. But there it is just the same, like a 
	  theme of [Edward Alexander] McDowell's, waiting for the ear of beauty to find it, as in 
	  this half-stanza of his "Exhortation" (to Ethiopia):</p>

	  <quote source="#exhortation-summer-1919">
	    <lg>
	      <l>In the East the clouds grow crimson with the new dawn that is breaking,</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">And its golden glory fills the western skies:—</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">Oh my brothers and my sisters, wake! Arise!</l>
	      <l>For the new birth rends the old earth, and the very dead are waking.</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">Ghosts are turned flesh, throwing off the grave's disguise,</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">And the foolish—even children—are made wise;</l>
	      <l>For the big earth groans in travail for the strong, new world in making—</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">Oh my brothers, dreaming for long centuries,</l>
	      <l rend="indent1">Wake from sleeping: to the East turn, turn your eyes!</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  <p>This will stand the test of thinking and that quality of thought stands out in most of 
	  Mr. McKay's work. He means something. He doesn't let the rhyme rule the thought nor 
	  the ink guide the pen.</p>

	  <p>Perhaps the most arresting poem in this volume is the one entitled <ref target="#a-memory-of-june">"A Memory of 
	  June."</ref> Its theme is too intimate for reproduction here; but it is the one in which our 
	  poet comes nearest to letting himself go. <ref target="#the-lynching">"The Lynching,"</ref> <ref target="#on-broadway">"On Broadway,"</ref> <ref target="#harlem-shadows">"Harlem Shadows,"</ref> and <ref target="#the-harlem-dancer">"The Harlem Dancer"</ref> are noteworthy presentations of familiar themes.</p>

	  <p>We feel that the work of this poet should be better known. It is high in aim, in 
	  thought, in technique. And we gladly bespeak for this volume of genuine poetry a place 
	  in the affection of our folk.</p>

	    <p>THE BOOK OF AMERICAN NEGRO
	    POETRY. Chosen and Edited by James
	    Weldon Johnson. Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co.</p>

	    <p>If they are right—the prophets
	    who predict the eventual submersion
	    of the white race in a
	    "rising tide of color"—this decade
	    may come to be known as the
	    first black renaissance. Even without
	    the perspective of time, we can see
	    how curiously this generation has been
	    influenced by the dark strain. African
	    sculpture has made a powerful impress
	    on the art of our day. American music
	    music reflects, in an increasing strength, the
	    savage insistence of Congo drum beats,
	    as well as the syncopated poignance of
	    our Southern spirituals. In sociology
	    the negro has begun to be his own interpreter,
	    W. E. Burghardt Du Bois,
	    editor of "The Crisis," has made two
	    important contributions to the psychology
	    of the suppressed race in "The
	    Souls of Black Folk" and "Darkwater."
	    Benjamin Brawley, author of that excellent
	    handbook, "A Short History of
	    the English Drama," has done splendid
	    pioneer's work with his "The Negro in
	    Art" and "A Social History of the
	    American Negro."</p>

	    <p>In literature the field is more uneven.
	    In <hi rend='italics'>belles lettres</hi>, criticism and
	    purely creative work the negro seems
	    to suffer from an inhibition that prevents
	    him from expressing his own
	    emotions. Instead of giving free rein
	    to a vision sharply differentiated from
	    that of his white compatriots, he is
	    content to ape their gestures, their
	    inflections—too anxious to imitate with
	    a stammering complaisance their own
	    imitations. Instead of being proudly
	    race conscious, he is too often merely
	    self-conscious.</p>

	    <p>A Harlem Freud may some day rise
	    to explain this quality in terms of mass
	    repression; the negro as artist suffers, 
	    he may conclude, from a race inferiority
	    complex. The implications of
	    such an analysis are too deep and far-reaching
	    for an article as superficial
	    as this. They would, however, find
	    repercussions in a recently published
	    collection of poems chosen and edited
	    by James Weldon Johnson, himself a
	    poet, as was proved by his original
	    volume, "Fifty Years."</p>
	  </div>

	  <div type='section'>
	    <p>"The Book of Negro Poetry"
	    is a record of the successes as
	    well as the failures of the American
	    negro (or, as Mr. Johnson prefers to
	    call him, the Aframerican) as poet.
	    Here are lyrics as native, as genuinely
	    emotional, as "A Death Song" and
	    "Little Brown Baby," by Paul Laurence
	    Dunbar, and here, also, are verses as
	    maudlin and imitative as "Ships That
	    Pass in the Night" by the same writer.
	    Here are rhapsodies as passionate as
	    "A Litany of Atlanta," by <sic>W. E. 
	    Du Bois</sic>, and quatrains as cryptic as the
	    obviously Robinsonian echoes of that
	    ardent anthologist, William Stanley
	    Braithwaite. Fenton Johnson adopts,
	    without hesitation or apology, Master's
	    Spoon River idiom, but his angry intensity
	    is his own.</p>

	    <p>The outstanding discoveries of this
	    collection are two, and they are less
	    familiar—even to their own race. They
	    are Claude McKay and Anne Spencer.
	    McKay does not disguise either himself
	    or his poetry; his lines are saturated
	    with a people's passion: they are
	    colored with a mixture of bitterness
	    and beauty. McKay's quieter and
	    idyllic moments are less noteworthy;
	    his muse is more characteristic when
	    she is rebellious than resigned. This
	    singer does not mistake polemics for
	    poetry; he knows to evoke a
	    power of communication without shouting
	    at the top of his voice. <ref target='#the-lynching'>"The
	    Lynching"</ref> proves this. So does the
	    impulsive sonnet, <ref target='#to-the-white-fiends'>"To the White
	    Fiends,"</ref> and this significant outcry,
	    written during the recent race riots:

	    <quote source='#if-we-must-die'>
	      <lg type='poem'>
		<head>If We Must Die</head>

		<lg type='stanza'>
		  <l>If we must die—let it not be like hogs</l>
		  <l>Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,</l>
		  <l>While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,</l>
		  <l>Making their mock at our accursed lot.</l>
		  <l>If we must die—oh, let us nobly die,</l>
		  <l>So that our precious blood may not be shed</l>
		  <l>In vain, then even the monsters we defy</l>
		  <l>Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!</l>
		</lg>

		<lg type='stanza'>
		  <l>Oh, kinsmen! We must meet the common foe,</l>
		  <l>Though far outnumbered, let us still be brave,</l>
		  <l>And, for their thousand blows, deal one death blow!</l>
		  <l>What though before us lies the open grave?</l>
		  <l>Like men we'll face the murderous cowardly pack,</l>
		  <l>Pressed to the wall, dying, but—fighting back!</l>
		</lg>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>
	    </p>

	    <p>Anne Spencer's work sounds the other
	    extreme of the gamut. Her verse is
	    remarkably restrained, closely woven,
	    intellectually complex. "The Wife-Woman"
	    and "Translation" are steeped
	    in a philosophy that has metaphysical
	    overtones. But there is a racial opulence,
	    an almost barbaric heat in the
	    color of her lines.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div type='section'>
	    <p>The names of Alex Rogers, J. W.
	    Johnson and Paul Dunbar—all of
	    whom wrote well known lyrics for
	    popular songs like "Lover's Lane," "Nobody"
	    and "The Jonah Man"—recall
	    the negro composers who promised so
	    much and who have performed so little. 
	    Will Marion Cook, one of the ablest
	    musicians ever produced in America,
	    startle us with the amazing "Rain
	    Song," originally written for a Williams
	    and Walker show.</p>

	    <p>H. T. Burleigh is another negro composer
	    who apparently has been ruined
	    by the conservatories. W. C. Handy
	    must be given credit for an entire
	    tendency which originated with his
	    "Memphis Blues." What has happened
	    to him? Or to Rosamond Johnson,
	    most adroit of ragtime adapters? Or
	    to Nathaniel Dett, whose "Listen to de
	    Lambs" is one of the most eloquent
	    pieces of choral writing ever scored by
	    an American? Is the answer to be
	    found, in spite of the negro's bursts of
	    enthusiasm and gusto, in his lack of
	    sustained effort? In a sheer inability
	    to cope with the strain of continued
	    creative effort?</p>

	    <p>In short, is this almost equal alternation
	    of achievement and failure a
	    physical or a psychical thing? This
	    collection poses such questions even
	    though it does not pretend to supply
	    the answers. What it does supply is
	    a full sized portrait of the American
	    negro's contribution to a definitely
	    American art. It shows that if the
	    Aframerican has not yet had his
	    renaissance, his poetry has at least
	    passed its pains of parturition. It is
	    no discredit to him that, with two exceptions,
	    the most balanced and cumulative
	    contribution to this compilation
	    is Mr. Johnson's forty-page preface. It
	    is a mark of which any group could
	    allow itself to be proud.</p>

	  <p>Contemplating the title of
	  this collection of poems by a
	  negro, I am reminded of a
	  negro playwright whom I met
	  in Chicago writing to ask me if I would
	  not come "into the shadows" to see him—"out
	  of that wider world in which
	  you live and move." He was afraid
	  that my respectable landlady would
	  object to a "nigger" calling to see me.</p>

	  <p>When nature places an agile, sensitive
	  brain in a skull over which a black
	  skin is stretched she creates one of
	  her most ironical situations. For the
	  possessor of that brain, to the average
	  white man, will never be in any wise
	  different from George the Pullman porter.
	  He will be synonymous with crap
	  games, razors and good-natured, deferential
	  inanity.</p>

	  <p>Claude McKay has tasted fully of
	  the irony, the sheer tragedy, of such a
	  situation. An authentic singer, his
	  head full of music and sensuous imagery,
	  his heart of nostalgia for his native
	  Jamaica, he has been compelled to earn
	  a living in America by doing everything
	  from "pot wrestling" in a boarding-house
	  kitchen to waiting on dining-car
	  patrons.</p>

	  <p>Usually, as in the sonnet <ref target="#america">"America,"</ref>
	  he is brave and defiant. Occasionally,
	  as in the title poem, he becomes bitter.
	  At his best he produces the sort of instinctive
	  lyricism that is found in folk-songs.
	  At his worst—and the worst
	  poem in the book is probably "When
	  Dawn Comes to the City"—he comes
	  perilously close to doggerel.</p>

	  <p>Nostalgia is achingly expressed in
	  <ref target="#the-tropics-in-new-york">"The Tropics in New York,"</ref> and there
	  is dreadful heartbreak in <ref target="#wild-may">"Wild
	  May."</ref></p>

	  <p>It is no use looking in this book for
	  elaborate nuances or a subtle music.</p>

	  <p>What does exist in it is a natural
	  lyricism.</p>

	  <p>HARLEM SHADOWS, by Claude McKay (Harcourt, Brace, &amp; Co, New York).</p>

	  <p>After swallowing these poems (as I 
	  did), one is able to appreciate why 
	  Claude McKay is idolized by lovers of 
	  the beautiful in poetry. Every poem 
	  is a gem—not a mediocre one is in the 
	  entire batch. Yes, we risk saying that, 
	  despite our limited knowledge of the 
	  fundamentals of poetry. As George 
	  Santayana says, Claude McKay "paints 
	  in again into the landscape the tints 
	  which the intellect has allowed to fade 
	  from it."</p>

	  <quote source='#to-one-coming-north'>
	    <lg>
	      <l rend='indent1'>Like white moths trembling on the tropic air.</l>
	      <l>Or waters of the hills that softly flow</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>Gracefully falling down a shining stair.</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  <p>We have been hearing quite a deal 
	  recently about the virtues (?) of the 
	  women in Claude McKay's poems. 
	  Essentially an artist, it is not always 
	  easy to feel the pulse of the master 
	  poet. It is not condescending to say 
	  that the Negro, educated though he 
	  may be, is devoid of the true artistic 
	  outlook. Experience is what counts 
	  in an artist's life. Lafcadio Hearn 
	  used to advise his Japanese students 
	  not to bother with books, but to go 
	  out in the large arena of life and 
	  there get ideas. Super-artist that he 
	  is, Claude McKay has done the very 
	  thing. Experience has been the mother 
	  of his poetry. And this, understand, 
	  is foreign—entirely so—to the life and 
	  character of the artist. One may be 
	  with the mob and yet not be of it!</p>

	      <l>My mouth give utterance to any moan.</l>
	      <l>The yawning over spits forth fiery spears:</l>
	      <l>Red aspish tongues shout wordlessly my name.</l>
	      <l>Desire destroys, consumes my mortal fears,</l>
	      <l>Transforming me into a shape of flame.</l>

	  <p>There, in so many lines, is the poet-artist's

	  <p>Spring publications in the field 
	  of poetry are meagre. No one 
	  book of superior excellence 
	  stands out, although there are 
	  a number of volumes in which 
	  the public will take more or less interest...
	  </p>

	  <p>More conservative measures are to 
	  be discovered in "Harlem Shadows," 
	  by Claude McKay. This 
	  young negro is responsible for a 
	  bulk of poetry that seems quite new 
	  from his race. In the past we have 
	  judged the negro in poetry by Paul 
	  Lawrence Dunbar and other writers 
	  who kept more or less closely to the 
	  dialect medium. Mr. McKay does 
	  not employ dialect at all. He strives 
	  to portray the spirit of the modern 
	  negro in a high and lofty manner.</p>

	  <p>Most of the time he succeeds, although 
	  it must be admitted that certain 
	  portions of his book unravel 
	  into mere sentiment. Such efforts 
	  as his <ref target="#flame-heart">"Flame Heart,"</ref> however, 
	  <choice><sic>exhibihit</sic><corr>exhibit</corr></choice> admirably the deal of color 
	  that he can capture in his stanzas. 
	  This poem is too long to quote, so 
	  Mr. McKay must be represented by 
	  "Heritage," a finely worded lyric 
	  of genuine strength</p>

	  <quote source="#heritage">

	  <div type="section">
	    <p>For years the great poet has been regarded as the highest 
	    manifestation of the intellectual, esthetic, and in many cases spiritual, 
	    powers of a race. In the names that have come down through 
	    history it is those of the great poets that blaze out brightest. It 
	    is chiefly upon the achievements of such poets that races and 
	    peoples claim greatness for themselves.</p>

	    <p>There are, of course, four names which in their influence 
	    and appeal stand on a level with or even above the greatest poets. 
	    They are Buddha, Confucius, Christ and Mohammed. But these 
	    four great religious teachers were after all great ethical poets. 
	    Judged in every light they do represents the highest peaks of the 
	    genius of the races that produced them. But these names are 
	    limited to oriental races. No occidental race has yet produced 
	    a great religious teacher. Among the occidental peoples the great 
	    poet still stands almost unrivaled. There are other lists, of course, 
	    that contain names of wide influence and appeal. For example, 
	    that soldiers' list can show Alexander, Cæsar and Napoleon. But 
	    there is not an occidental people in which the final test would not 
	    put its greatest poet above its greatest soldier.</p>
	    
	    <p>The times are slightly changed and the <choice><sic>glamor</sic><corr>glamour</corr></choice> about the 
	    poet may be somewhat dimmed. We are living in a very material 
	    age, and the man of science, the man who is able to bend 
	    the forces of nature to the well being of humanity is coming into 
	    <choice><sic>ascendency</sic><corr>ascendancy</corr></choice>. There may come a time when from achievements 
	    in science there will spring names that will shed a luster as bright 
	    and enduring as the names of Homer, Shakespeare, Dante, Moliere 
	    and Goethe.</p>

	    <p>However, to my mind, this is improbable. The materialism 
	    of the present age may be but a transitory state. Moreover, although 
	    the scientist may contribute what in the <choice><orig>ultilitarian</orig><corr>utilitarian</corr></choice> sense 
	    is far more important to humanity, he can never take hold of the 
	    imaginations of men and stir their souls like the poet. It therefore 
	    seems that as <choice><orig>lon gas</orig><corr>long as</corr></choice> man loves the beautiful the great poet 
	    will hold his supreme place.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div type="section">
	    <p>I have indulged in this rather weighty sounding introduction 
	    simply to induce a train of thought. I wish my readers to think 
	    of the production of poets by a race as a vital thing. It is vital 
	    not only as an indication of the development of the race but it is 
	    vital as to the place and recognition which that race is given 
	    by the world at large.</p>

	    <p>In accordance with the temper of the age, and more particularly, 
	    in accordance with false ideas with which the mind of 
	    the Negro in American has been impregnated, we Aframericans 
	    are prone to think of one of our number who conducts a successful 
	    corner grocery store as being far more vital and important as a 
	    factor in our progress than one who turns out a sheaf of poems, 
	    even though the poems are real poetry. We are prone to think of 
	    the grocer as one who is laying <sic>foundations</sic> stones in our racial 
	    greatness and of the poet as doing little more than wasting his 
	    time.</p>

	    <p>Without disparaging the successful grocer, I must say that 
	    this evaluation is all wrong. It would be interesting, if it were 
	    possible, to calculate how many successful Negro grocers it would 
	    take to equal the force of Paul Laurence Dunbar as a factor in 
	    the progress of the race and in having the progress recognized by 
	    the world. I am now driving at the truth contained in the words 
	    of Jesus Christ when He said, "Man shall not live by bread alone." 
	    If the race would develop its greatness and highest possibilities 
	    it needs not only to support its grocers but also to appreciate 
	    its poets.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div type="section">
	    <p>All this is merely introductory to a few words to call attention 
	    to a Negro poet who has risen like a new and flaming 
	    star on the horizon. The poet is Claude McKay.</p>

	    <p>Mr. McKay deserves a fully and prompt appreciation. We 
	    should not do in his case what were guilty of in the case of 
	    Dunbar, that was, not to recognize or not even to know his greatness 
	    until it was acclaimed by the whites.</p>

	    <p>Mr. McKay is a real poet and a great poet. I mean by this 
	    that he has both the poetic endowment and the ability to make 
	    that endowment articulate, and he is yet far from his full growth. 
	    He is still a young man. He is a poet of beauty and a poet of 
	    power. No Negro poet has sung more beautifully of his own race 
	    than McKay and no Negro poet has equalled the power with which 
	    he expresses the bitterness that so often rises in the heart of the 
	    race. As an example of that power we quote his sonnet, "If We 
	    Must Die," written after the <choice><sic>tetrrible</sic><corr>terrible</corr></choice> riots in the summer of 1919:
	    <quote source="#if-we-must-die">
	      <lg>
		<lg>
		  <l>If we must die, let it not be like hogs</l>
		  <l>Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,</l>
		  <l>While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,</l>
		  <l>Making their mock at our accursed lot.</l>
		  <l>If we must die, O let us nobly die,</l>
		  <l>So that our precious blood may not be shed</l>
		  <l>In vain: then even the monsters we defy</l>
		  <l>Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!</l>
		</lg>

		<lg>
		  <l>O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe!</l>
		  <l>Though far outnumbered let us show us brace,</l>
		  <l>And for their thousand blows deal one deathblow!</l>
		  <l>What though before us lies the open grave?</l>
		  <l>Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack,</l>
		  <l>Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!</l>
		</lg>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>The race ought to be proud of a poet capable of voicing it so
	    fully. Such a voice is not found every day.</p>

	    <p>Mr. McKay's volume, "Harlem Shadows," published by Harcourt, 
	    Brace &amp; Company, New York, is already attracting the 
	    attention of the critics of the country. What he has achieved 
	    in this little volume sheds honor upon the whole race.</p>

	  <div type='section'>
	    <p>Three recent books of verse by
	    Negroes afford an excellent opportunity
	    for those interested in such matters
	    to examine into the literary development
	    of the race and incidentally
	    into the changing temper of its literary
	    spokesman.</p>

	    <p>The Negro of slavery and the years
	    immediately following the emancipation
	    is represented in "Negro Folk
	    Rhymes" (Macmillan), a collection of
	    folk verse made of Prof. Thomas W.
	    Talley, of Fisk University. These
	    rhymes have no known author. They
	    grew up among the Negroes and were
	    developed by repetition and adjustment
	    until they reached the form in which
	    they are now reported in the South.
	    They are dance songs and love songs,
	    songs of animal and nature lore, charms
	    and incantations, and so on. It is remarkable
	    that there are so few in the
	    whole collection that show any realization
	    of the enslavement of the Negro
	    or any resentment against that condition.
	    Almost without exception the
	    rhymes indicate an acceptance of the
	    world and a cheerful adaptation to it.
	    Even where there is resentment against
	    slavery it is not argued but exhibited
	    indirectly. Take, for example, "Promises
	    of Freedom," in which the singer
	    tells how the master promised to set
	    him free and broke the promise. It
	    continues:

	    <quote>
	      <lg>
		<l>Ole Mosser lakwise promise me,</l>
		<l>W'en he died, he'd set me free,</l>
		<l>But ole Mosser go an' make his Will</l>
		<l>Fer to leave me a-plowin' ole Beck still.</l>
	      </lg>

	      <lg>
		<l>Yes, my ole Mosser promise me;</l>
		<l>But "his papers" didn' leave me free,</l>
		<l>A doze of pizen helped 'im along,</l>
		<l>May de Devil preach 'is funer'l song.</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>
	    </p>

	    <p>One may assume that the slave had
	    something to do with the poison, but
	    there is no moralizing or justifying of
	    resentment against injustice. The fact
	    is stated with the simplicity of a primitive
	    people.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div type='section'>
	    <p rend='italics'>A similar simplicity rules in the
	    songs of nature, a simplicity that
	    sometimes becomes beautiful.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div type='section'>
	    <p>There is no sophisticated and
	    trained poet who could produce more
	    nearly perfect things than some that
	    have been handed down by word of
	    mouth among untutored Negroes.
	    Only a person with a sensitive ear and
	    a feeling for rhythm could have produced
	    the 'Bob White Song':

	    <quote>
	      <lg>
		<l>Bob white! Bob White!</l>
		<l>Is yo' peas all ripe?</l>
		<l>No—! not—! quite!</l>
	      </lg>

	      <lg>
		<l>Bob white! Bob white!</l>
		<l>W'en will dey be ripe?</l>
		<l>Tomor—! row! night!</l>
	      </lg>

	      <lg>
		<l>Bob white! Bob white!</l>
		<l>Does you sing at night?</l>
		<l>No—! not—! quite!</l>
	      </lg>

	      <lg>
		<l>Bob white! Bob white!</l>
		<l>W'en is de time right?</l>
		<l>At can—! dle—! light!</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>
	    </p>

	    <p>Of course, many of the rhymes in
	    the volume are little more than nonsense
	    jingles. They are the product of
	    a comparatively happy and irresponsible
	    phase of the life of the Negro in America.
	    There is no conscious literary art,
	    no introspection and no philosophizing.
	    These things had to wait until a later
	    period.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div type='section'>
	    <p rend='italics'>Within the past twenty years the
	    Negroes have become conscious literary
	    artists.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div type='section'>
	    <p>They have written such a considerable
	    volume of poetry as to justify
	    the production of an anthology. Under
	    the title of "The Book of American
	    Negro Poetry" (Harcourt, Brace &amp;
	    Co.), James Weldon Johnson has set
	    forth selections from the work of more
	    than thirty Negroes who have published
	    verse since the late Paul Laurence Dunbar
	    began to write. Mr. Johnson says
	    in his preface that more than one hundred
	    Negroes in the United States have
	    published volumes of poetry and that
	    only thirty of them came between
	    Phillis Wheatley and Dunbar. The remaining
	    seventy belong to the present
	    and the recent past. It is evident that
	    a literary consciousness is awakening
	    in the race. And after Mr.
	    Johnson's anthology one must admit
	    that the Negro has a gift for poetry,
	    even if the simpler and more spontaneous
	    folk rhymes in Prof. Talley's
	    volume had not demonstrated it.</p>

	    <p>There is no great poetry in the volume;
	    that is hardly to be expected.
	    But there is a considerable body of good
	    poetry, distinguished by imagination
	    and insight and written with a fine
	    sense of the requirements of verse.
	    Some of the poets represented are educated
	    men, college professors or preachers
	    or journalists. Others are more
	    humble workers, one of the best having
	    been a kitchen worker in a restaurant.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div type='section'>
	    <p rend='italics'>Many of these modern Negro poets
	    express their resentment against the
	    race that once enslaved their ancestors
	    and even now lynches their
	    fellows.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div type='section'>
	    <p>Mr. Johnson, who has put his
	    own poem, "Brothers," into his
	    anthology is much more tolerant than
	    some of the others, for he only
	    makes the white who have burned a Negro at
	    the stake for an atrocious crime wonder
	    what the victim meant when he said,
	    "Brothers in spirit, brothers in deed
	    are we." Claude McKay, of whom I
	    shall speak a little later, is voluble with
	    hater. Joseph S. Cotter, Jr., merely
	    asks:
	    <quote>
	      <lg>
		<l>Why do men sneer when I arise</l>
		<l>And stand in their councils,</l>
		<l>And look them eye to eye,</l>
		<l>And speak their tongue?</l>
		<l>Is it because I am black?</l>

	    <p>The late James D. Corrothers was
	    in a very different mood when he wrote
	    of the obstacles in the way of recognition
	    for a Negro versemaker:
	    <quote>
	      <lg>
		<l>Thus, my true Brother, dream-led, I</l>
		<l rend='indent1'>Forfend the anathema, following the span.</l>
		<l>I hold my head as proudly high</l>
		<l rend='indent1'>As any man.</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>
	    </p>
	  </div>

	  <div type='section'>
	    <p rend='italics'>But the Negro poet has not yet
	    arise who sees any overruling
	    Providence in the forced migration of
	    his ancestors from Africa.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div type='section'>
	    <p>The bitterest of the whole company
	    is Claude McKay, whose name appears
	    on the title page of "Harlem
	    Shadows" (Harcourt, Brace, &amp; Co.)
	    Mr. McKay was born in Jamaica of
	    slave ancestors. He came to this country
	    in 1912 and has lived here since,
	    and has received the medal of the Institute
	    of Arts and Sciences in recognition
	    of his verse. When he came to
	    the United States he intended to study
	    agriculture and go back to Jamaica and
	    teach it to his people. He had not
	    been here more than two years before
	    he gave up the study and abandoned
	    the plan to return to his native island.
	    He earned a living at whatever work he
	    could get. For a time he was a waiter
	    in the dining car on the railroad between
	    this city and New York. One
	    of his poems is an expression of disgust
	    for the diners and other waiters
	    alike. Another begins
	    <quote source='#the-white-city'>
	      <lg>
		<l>I will not toy with it nor bend an inch.</l>
		<l rend='indent1'>Deep in the secret chambers of my heart</l>
		<l>I nurse my life-long hate, and without flinch</l>
		<l rend='indent1'>I bear it nobly as I live my part.</l>
	      </lg>
	    </quote>
	    </p>

	    <p>In poem after poem he varies this
	    expression of hatred, until it seems as
	    if it were a morbid obsession. Yet he
	    has written a tenderly beautiful piece
	    about his mother and some love lyrics
	    that sing.</p>

	    <p>It is not strange that the Negro
	    should feel resentment at the wrongs
	    his race has suffered at the hands of
	    the whites. But as he grows in spiritual
	    and intellectual stature he will discover
	    that hatred will not redress a
	    single wrong nor elevate him a single
	    inch. It is from the poet, who is supposed
	    to see more deeply and more
	    clearly than the rest of us, that the recognition
	    of the futility of hate is expected.
	    Was it not Tennyson who said
	    that the poet should be dowered with
	    the hate of hate and the scorn of scorn.</p>

	  <p>"HARLEM SHADOWS" By Claude McKay, published by
	  Harcourt Brace and Co., Price $1.35.
	  Postage 10c Extra.</p>

	  <p>Claude McKay was born in the West
	  Indies and had attained to some distinction
	  there before he came to the
	  United States. He had written exquisite
	  songs in the Jamaican dialect,
	  songs full of a love for the simple
	  peasant folk and a longing for their
	  full liberty, he had helped the street
	  car men on strike, he had received
	  the medal of the institute of Arts and
	  Sciences. And then he came to New
	  York. And though he sings of New
	  York as a city which he hates; we,
	  who love it, can rest content that he
	  stays with us. Hate is next to love
	  and far better than indifference.</p>

	  <p>"Harlem Shadows" centres about
	  New York, but to the poet's heart
	  again and again comes the call of the
	  Tropics. It is Easter Sunday and
	  he thinks:
	  <quote source='#the-easter-flower'>
	    <lg>
	      <l>"Far from this foreign Easter damp and chilly</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>My soul steals to a pear-shaped plot of ground,</l>
	      <l>Where gleamed the lilac-tinted Easter lily</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>Soft-scented in the air for yards around."</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>
	  </p>

	  <p>He stops at a shop window and
	  <quote source='#the-tropics-in-new-york'>
	    <lg>
	      <l>"Bananas ripe and green, and ginger-root,</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>Cocoa in pods and alligator pears.</l>
	      <l>And tangerines and mangoes and grape-fruit—"</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>
	  recall the laden fruit-trees of home
	  and the mystical blue skies. He goes
	  into the subway, the city's "great,
	  gaunt gut" where "the gray train
	  rushing bears the weary wind" and
	  to him the wind is captive, moaning
	  for fields and seas:
	  <quote source='#subway-wind'>
	    <lg>
	      <l>"Seas cooling warm where native schooners drift</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>Through sleepy waters, while gulls wheel and sweep,</l>
	      <l>Waiting for windy waves the keels to lift</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>Lightly among the islands of the deep."</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>
	  </p>

	  <p>The swallows fly North up from the
	  Spanish main and he questions them.
	  They have seen the children scampering
	  out of school:
	  <quote source='#homing-swallows'>
	    <lg>
	      <l>"Do they still stop beneath the giant tree</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>To gather locusts in their childish greed,</l>
	      <l>And chuckle when they break the pods to see</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>The golden powder clustered round the seed?"</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>
	  </p>

	  <p>Weary, he turns to the South as
	  the land of waking dreams.
	  <quote source='#north-and-south'>
	    <lg>
	      <l>"There by the banks of the blue and silver streams</l>

	      <l rend='indent1'>Their tongues outstretched for careless little flies,</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>Look upward laughing at the smiling skies."</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>
	  </p>

	  <p>When night comes he thinks of the
	  "dainty Spanish needle" the yellow
	  and white flower "shadowed by the
	  spreading mango." And in the New
	  York dawn of groaning cars and rumbling
	  milks carts, of dark figures
	  shuffling sadly to work, he calls up
	  his island of the sea.

	  </quote>
	  </p>

	  <p>But America has a grip upon Claude
	  McKay. He tells us so in a wonderful
	  sonnet.

	  <quote source='#america'>
	    <lg>
	      <l>"Although she feed me bread of bitterness,</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>And sinks into my throat her tiger's <sic>took</sic>,</l>
	      <l>Stealing my breath of life, I will confess</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>I love this cultured hell that tests my youth."</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>
	  </p>

	  <p>He has written <ref target='#the-lynching'>two great sonnets
	  upon lynching</ref> and two <sic>unforgetable</sic>
	  pictures of women, <ref target='#harlem-shadows'>Harlem Shadows</ref>
	  and <ref target='#the-harlem-dancer'>The Harlem Dancer</ref>. As he explains
	  in his preface, America has
	  greatly affected his poetry at times,
	  but it has not yet taught him to use
	  free verse.</p>

	  <p>Max Eastman, himself a poet as
	  well as a rare critic of poetry, has
	  written an Introduction to Mr. McKay's
	  poems. I quote the end:</p>

	  <quote source='#introduction'>
	    <p>"The quality is here in all these
	    songs, the pure, arrowlike <sic>tranference</sic>
	    of his emotion into our heart,
	    without any but the inevitable words, 
	    the quality that reminds us of Burns
	    and Villon and <sic>Catallus</sic>, and all the
	    poets that we call lyric because we
	    love them so much. It is the quality
	    that Keats sought to cherish when
	    he said that 'Poetry should be great
	    and <sic>unobstrusive</sic>, a thing which enters
	    into the soul, and does not startle
	    or amaze with itself but with its
	    subject.' * * * It is the poetry that
	    looks upon a thing and sings.</p>
	    <p>It is possessed by a feeling and
	    sings. May it find its way a little
	    quietly and softly in this age of roar
	    and advertising, to the hearts that
	    love a true and unaffected song."</p>

	    <note type="editorial">Cooper calls this "perhaps the longest and most appreciative review of <title level="j">Harlem Shadows</title>. Cooper quotes a letter from McKay to Kirnon in which McKay praises Kirnon's "real feeling" for his poetry. "I am so sick of pretentious critics posturing about creative work which they haven't the understanding heart to comprehend" (qtd. in Cooper 165-166).</note>
	  </head>

	  <p>This simple appreciation of Claude 
	  McKay's poems is done in obedience to 
	  an appreciative urge which is too 
	  strong and insistent to be ignored entirely. 
	  I trust that my readers will 
	  try and study it in the spirit in 
	  which it is offered. It is not a boost. 
	  Indeed, I can lay no claim to this particular 
	  virtue, if it is really such.</p>

	  <p>I remember first reading of Claude 
	  McKay in <ref target='#supp_mckay_claude-mackay-describes'><title level='j'>Pearson's Magazine</title></ref>. I think 
	  it was in the summer of 1918. I was 
	  then living out of this city. It was 
	  an autobiographical sketch with a few 
	  of his poems appended. I took no particular 
	  interest in the writer or his 
	  poems at this time. In fact, I mislaid 
	  the magazine before I had the opportunity 
	  of rereading the article. Then 
	  at a later date I came across a poem 
	  entitled "Soul and Body" in Pearson's 
	  written by McKay. This poem made 
	  a profound impression upon me. From 
	  then up to this time I have entertained 
	  a profound interest and admiration for the 
	  writings of Mr. McKay.</p>

	  <p>In <title level='m'>Harlem Shadows</title> Claude McKay 
	  appears at good advantage. He exhibits 
	  ability and talent of no mean 
	  merit. I was suspicious of the soundness of 
	  Mr. Eric Walrond, of the 
	  <ref target='#review_walrond_book-notes'><title level='j'>Negro World</title> review</ref> when he said that 
	  there was not a mediocre poem in the entire 
	  lot. But I now fully endorse his 
	  opinion with added emphasis. In every 
	  poem there is exhibited a remarkable 
	  and subtle balancing of thought and 
	  emotion of a nature that is rare indeed.
	  Nothing really essential to goody poetry 
	  is over-emphasized or sacrificed. A 
	  wonderful sense of harmony and completeness 
	  prevails throughout the entire 
	  volume. There is nowhere any 
	  attempt at being clever, big or showy. 
	  There is a complete absence of affectation. 
	  His power lies in his simplicity. 
	  He does not choose "big" themes. He 
	  absolutely refuses to be imposed upon 
	  by himself with shallow and hollow
	  <choice><orig>pretences</orig><corr>pretenses</corr></choice>. He follows with an unpretentious 
	  docility, his natural inclinations 
	  in the selection of themes. He 
	  seems to write under no other urge 
	  than that of natural impulse, and what 
	  seems strangely interesting is that his 
	  knowledge and impulse seem so trained 
	  towards perfection that no subject is 
	  being ill-treated by lack of treatment 
	  of overtreatment.</p>

	  <p>It is to Mr. McKay's credit that he 
	  does not specialize in any sort of propaganda 
	  themes, whether they be racial 
	  or otherwise. The big soul is universal. 
	  There are very few of his poems that 
	  would not make a universal human appeal 
	  regardless of time, place or circumstance. 
	  The spirit and thoughts 
	  expressed in his work are fundamental 
	  life experiences in some form or other 
	  in all human beings.</p>

	  <p>In order of arrangement the poem, 
	  "America," makes a very powerful appeal 
	  to me. I quote the first four lines:</p>

	  <quote source='#america'>
	    <lg>
	      <l>Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>And sinks into my throat her tiger's tooth,</l>
	      <l>Stealing my breath of life, I will confess</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>I love this cultured hell that tests my youth!</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  <p>The last line truly expresses in a 
	  most satisfactory manner what I have 
	  always felt and thought to be the main 
	  redeeming feature of America. And I 
	  daresay many other aliens like myself 
	  have felt and thought in like manner 
	  without ever giving them expression.</p>

	  <p>McKay penetrates and probes to a 
	  depth not to be easily surpassed the 
	  spiritual isolation and loneliness which 
	  many of us—rich and poor, white and 
	  black—have felt quite often in the 
	  heart of the noise and bustle of this 
	  great city in the poem <ref target='#on-broadway'>"On Broadway."</ref> 
	  He speaks for the many lonely, struggling, 
	  straggling souls that are stranded 
	  in awful loneliness amidst the great 
	  crowds.</p>

	  <p>An outstanding feature of McKay is 
	  his poetical fancy for things that appear 
	  even to the observant and responsive, 
	  meaningless and commonplace. 
	  At his hands they live and throb 
	  with life. They are humanized. 
	  As a typical example I take the "Subway 
	  Wind." I select the following lines, for they 
	  vividly portray the theme:</p>

	  <quote source='#subway-wind'>
	    <lg>
	      <l>Far down, down through the city's great, gaunt gut,</l>
	      <l>The gray train rushing bears the weary wind;</l>
	      <l>In the packed cars the fans the crowd's breath cut,</l>
	      <l>Leaving the sick and heavy air behind.</l>
	      <l>And pale-cheeked children seek the upper door</l>
	      <l>To give their summer jackets to the breeze;</l>
	      <l>Their laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar</l>
	      <l>Of captive wind that moans for fields and seas.</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  <p>Another pertinent feature of this 
	  volume of poems is that one really 
	  cannot be but conscious of the "genuine 
	  breath of the tropics," to use Mr. 
	  Hubert Harrison's words. A certain 
	  mildness and serenity pervades and 
	  permeates nearly every poem. McKay 
	  is a lover of nature. Of that there 
	  is no doubt. There are several poems 
	  dealing with one or the other aspect 
	  of nature. There are <ref target='#the-easter-flower'>"The Easter 
	  Flower,"</ref> <ref target='#winter-in-the-country'>"Winter in the Country,"</ref> <ref target='#to-winter'>"To 
	  Winter,"</ref> <ref target='#spring-in-new-hampshire'>"Spring in New Hampshire,"</ref> 
	  <ref target='#north-and-south'>"North and South,"</ref> and others. The 
	  last named is of excellent quality, and, 
	  in my humble estimation, can stand 
	  comparison with some of the best of 
	  William Cullen Bryant and the great 
	  English singer of nature, William 
	  Wordsworth.</p>

	  <p>But these are not all by any means. 
	  McKay touches philosophical themes. 
	  He contemplates upon matters metaphysical. 
	  In <ref target='#i-know-my-soul'>"I Know My Soul"</ref> he 
	  shows a poetical philosophical bent 
	  that was so strongly characteristic of 
	  Omar and Goethe.</p>

	  <p>In conclusion, I wish to say that I 
	  am convinced that Mr. Claude McKay 
	  possesses an exceptional poetical talent. 
	  He is an esthetician in the best 
	  sense of the word. He is true to himself. 
	  At least, I feel that I am justified 
	  in making this statement. An honest 
	  work which is expressive of one's individuality 
	  is art in the creative sense. 
	  Imitation is always superficial at best 
	  when not made subordinate to the 
	  individual personality. Esthetic beauty 
	  is greater and beyond objective beauty. 
	  And this McKay seems to know. He 
	  records his own deepest soul experience 
	  in his most intense moods and, 
	  in so doing, he holds before his readers 
	  a true picture of their inner life; 
	  and in this recognition of self lies the 
	  possibility of spiritual growth. To 
	  understand and appreciate Claude McKay's 
	  poems, one must be capable of 
	  studying and understanding life 
	  through the emotions; for a sympathetic 
	  and appreciative understanding 
	  is possible only through the feelings.</p>

	    <p>Not all of the 32 poets quoted here give 
	    evidence of this cosmic quality, but 
	    there is a fair showing, notably Mrs. Georgia 
	    Douglas Johnson whose power however is 
	    checked by the narrowness of her medium 
	    of expression, Claude McKay and Anne 
	    Spencer. Of Claude McKay I shall speak 
	    later, but I wonder why we have not heard 
	    more of Anne Spencer. Her art and its 
	    expression are true and fine; she blends 
	    a delicate mysticism with a diamond clearness 
	    of exposition, and her subject matter 
	    is original.</p>
	    <p>This anthology itself has the value of an 
	    arrow pointing the direction of Negro 
	    genius, but the author's preface has a more 
	    immediate worth. It is not only a graceful 
	    bit of expository writing befitting a collection 
	    of poetry, but it affords a splendid 
	    compendium of the Negro's artistic contributions 
	    to America. Mr. Johnson feels 
	    that the Negro is the author of the only 
	    distinctively American artistic products. 
	    He lists his gifts as follows: Folk-tales 
	    such as we find in the Joel Chandler Harris 
	    collection; the Spirituals; the Cakewalk 
	    and Ragtime. What is still more important 
	    is the possession on the part of the Negro 
	    of what Mr. Johnson calls a "transfusive 
	    quality," that is the ability to adopt the 
	    original spirit of his milieu into something 
	    "artistic and original, which yet possesses 
	    the note of universal appeal."</p>

	    <p>The first thought that will flash into the 
	    mind of the reader of "Harlem Shadows" 
	    will be: <hi rend="italics">"This is poetry!"</hi> No other later 
	    discovery, a slight unevenness of power, a 
	    strange rhythm, the fact of the author's 
	    ancestry, will be able to affect that first 
	    evaluation. Mr. McKay possesses a deep 
	    emotionalism, a perception of what is 
	    fundamentally important to mankind everywhere—love 
	    of kind, love of home, and love 
	    of race. He is extraordinarily vivid in depicting 
	    these last two. <ref target="#flame-heart">"Flameheart"</ref> and 
	    <ref target="#my-mother">"My Mother"</ref> fill even the casual reader 
	    with a sense of longing for home and the 
	    first, fine love for parents. The warmth 
	    and sweetness of those days described in 
	    the former poem are especially alluring; 
	    the mind is caught by the concept of the 
	    poinsettia's redness as the eye is fixed by 
	    a flash of color. But Mr. McKay's nobler 
	    effort has been spent in the poems of 
	    <ref target="#america">"America"</ref> (quoted in this issue's <title rend="italics">Looking 
	    Glass</title>) is the finest example. He has dwelt 
	    in fiery, impassioned language on the sufferings 
	    of his race. Yet there is no touch 
	    of propaganda. This is the truest mark of 
	    genius.</p>
	    <p>Max Eastman prefaces these poems with

	  <p>There are few Americans of 
	  culture who have not heard and 
	  been thrilled by the weird, plaintive 
	  negro spirituals. There are others 
	  who know that modern jazz music was 
	  born of musically illiterate negro 
	  roustabouts on Mississippi levees. 
	  There are yet others who know of the 
	  beautiful dialect poetry of Paul Laurence 
	  Dunbar, and of the writings of 
	  Dr. DuBois, one of the great masters 
	  of prose in America.</p>

	  <p>Beyond these cultural gifts to <pb n="531" />
	  America, however, all that the negro 
	  has given us in the arts has been a 
	  closed book. A step toward acquainting 
	  America with these no inconsiderable 
	  gifts has been taken by James 
	  Weldon Johnson in "The Book of 
	  American Negro Poetry." Mr. Johnson 
	  is eminently qualified to undertake 
	  such a task, for he is recognized 
	  as one of the two foremost poets of 
	  his race and indeed, as one of the few 
	  worth while poets of America, regardless 
	  of race. He has gathered and 
	  examined the work of more than one 
	  hundred negro poets and carefully 
	  culled the best that has been done by 
	  thirty-one of them. Aside form the 
	  excellence of much of the verse, the 
	  most striking thing, even to the casual 
	  reader, is the versatility of these 
	  writers. There is much of good dialect 
	  but only a small portion is in that 
	  form. There is the colorful imaginative 
	  poetry of Anne Spencer in her 
	  "Before the Feast of Shushan," the 
	  strength of thought and charm of 
	  phrasing of Claude McKay, the 
	  lyrical beauty of Jessie Fauset, the emotionalism 
	  of Georgia Douglas Johnson, the 
	  polished modernity of William Stanley 
	  Braithwaite, the vigor and satire of 
	  James Weldon Johnson's protest 
	  against lynching in "Brothers" as well 
	  as the tenderness of his "Since You 
	  Went Away." It is but natural that 
	  the negro should <sic>propagandic</sic>—his 
	  lot in American never lets him forget 
	  that he is a "problem"—his is a bitter 
	  struggle for mere existence. Yet, 
	  many of the writers have been able 
	  to transcend racial lines, forgetting 
	  race problems in imaginative flights 
	  of rare beauty. Space forbids my 
	  quoting, to my regret. I would like 
	  to offer exhibits showing the wealth 
	  within its covers that makes the book 
	  so great a joy.</p>

	  <p>To me the most important and valuable 
	  portion of the book is the preface 
	  of some forty pages by Mr. Johnson 
	  on "The Creative Genius of the American 
	  Negro." In this he shows that 
	  the negro "is the creator of the only 
	  things artistic that have yet sprung 
	  from American soil and been universally 
	  acknowledged as distinctive 
	  American products." These are four 
	  in number: the Uncle Remus stories, 
	  America's only folk lore; the negro 
	  folk songs or spirituals; the cakewalk, 
	  which is distinctly American and from 
	  which sprang the modern society 
	  dances; and ragtime with its "great 
	  melodic beauty and amazing polyphonic 
	  structure." To read this essay 
	  is to gain a liberal education on the 
	  source of much of the few contributions 
	  America has made to the arts. 
	  If Americans knew and appreciated 
	  fully all that the negro has given to 
	  America, the race problem would be 
	  easy of solution.</p>

	  <p>Coincident with the publication of 
	  Mr. Johnson's book comes Claude 
	  McKay's "Harlem Shadows." Here is 
	  a young man, born in the British West 
	  Indies, who is without doubt the most 
	  talented and versatile of the new 
	  school of imaginative, emotional 
	  negro poets. Feeling intensely, at 
	  times bitterly, he succeeds, nevertheless, 
	  in preventing his emotions from 
	  affecting his genius as a poet. He has 
	  surety of expression, depth of feeling, 
	  the true lyric gift, and handles amazingly 
	  well subtle gradations of 
	  thought and of feeling. Mr. McKay 
	  is not a great negro poet—he is a great 
	  poet! This is his first book of verse 
	  to be published in the United States, 
	  but it will give him the high place 
	  among American poets to which he is 
	  rightfully entitled. I offer in evidence 
	  one of his shorter poems on which I 
	  ground my belief: <pb n="532" />
	  <quote source="#poetry">
	    <lg type="poem">
	      <l>Sometimes I tremble like a storm-swept flower,</l>
	      <l>And seek to hide my tortured soul from thee,</l>
	      <l>Bowing my head in deep humility</l>
	      <l>Before the silent thunder of thy power.</l>
	      <l>Sometimes I flee before thy blazing light,</l>
	      <l>As from the specter of pursuing death;</l>
	      <l>Intimated lest thy mighty breath,</l>
	      <l>Windways, will sweep me into utter night.</l>
	      <l>For, oh, I fear they will be swallowed up—</l>
	      <l>The loves that are to me of vital worth,</l>
	      <l>My passion and my pleasure in the earth—</l>
	      <l>And lost forever in thy magic cup!</l>
	      <l>I fear, I fear my truly human heart</l>
	      <l>Will perish on the altar-stone of art!</l>

	  </head>

	  <p>If it were possible to read Mr. Johnson's collection without 
	  knowing that all of it was written by Negroes, it 
	  is rather unlikely that one would think it remarkable in 
	  any way. One would be struck, here and there, by a certain 
	  simplicity, or technical competence, or musically flowing 
	  rhythm, or warmth of feeling, or occasional vivid 
	  phrase. Longer than any of these things, which are to be 
	  found in fairly good poetry anywhere, one would remember 
	  flashes of an aching indissoluble bitterness, a white anger 
	  stripped of all merely personal unhappiness, which, if one 
	  did not know by what oppressed it was uttered and against 
	  what oppressor, would be puzzling and disquieting.</p>

	  <p>But since it is known who wrote them, it is impossible 
	  to read these poems as one reads most poetry. There arise 
	  at once, from the auction block and cotton field and lynching 
	  post and Harlem slum, the faces of our dark step-children, 
	  whom we have mistreated and misunderstood, 
	  whose time of trouble is not yet over, who are struggling 
	  painfully out of darkness toward some degree of happiness 
	  in an alien land. We think of the general assumption—which 
	  has always been the master's excuse for keeping 
	  down the slave—that they are essentially inferior to us. 
	  Perhaps they are inferior in many of the things which our 
	  civilization likes to think are important—who can say so 
	  for sure? And who can say for sure that they are not 
	  our equals in some things, and in others even our betters?</p>

	  <p>They have their own fields to plough, which are not 
	  ours. The only music native to America is theirs; and in 
	  its particular quality of spontaneity, of free rhythm and 
	  rich harmonies, only possible in an uncomplicated spirit very 
	  near to the earth, there is nothing else like it in the world.</p>

	  <p>Is poetry one of their fields? Impossible to say as yet. 
	  On the strength of this collection by Negroes—nearly all 
	  now living—it is clear that they can write poetry as good 
	  as the great mass of ours, and they have produced one 
	  real poet, though by no means a great one—Mr. Claude 
	  McKay. It is an uneven collection. Too much of it is 
	  in the tradition of echoes, flowery phrase and emotion 
	  vaguely expressed which have always afflicted poetry. Too 
	  much of it is <choice><sic>modelled</sic><corr>modeled</corr></choice> after what is least worth copying. 
	  A good deal of it is in dialect, which always leaves me uneasy. 
	  Print cools and distorts phrases which, when spoken 
	  or sung, have a charming spontaneous gusto. Mr. 
	  Du Bois' "A Litany at Atlanta" is impressive, but as 
	  poetry is buttered to thick with indignation. Mr. Braithwaite's 
	  Sandy Star stirs pleasantly, like a light wind. Miss 
	  Spencer has great mastery over dreamy, half-mystical melodies. 
	  Mr. Fenton Johnson has a fine gift for direct observation 
	  and biting phrase in short prose poems whose 
	  reality makes him perhaps the most original contributor 
	  to the collection, though Mr. Claude McKay is by far 
	  the ablest poet.</p>

	  <p>I cannot quite agree with Mr. Max Eastman that Mr. 
	  McKay <quote source="#introduction">"reminds us of Burns and Villon and Catullus."</quote> 
	  I feel that a hospitality to echoes of poetry he has read 
	  has time and again obscured a direct sense of life, and made 
	  rarer those lines of singular intensity which express as 
	  Mr. Eastman aptly says, "the naked force of character." 
	  I am sorry he so often uses such indoor and inbred poetic 
	  phrases as <quote source="#to-one-coming-north">"the Northland wreathed in golden smiles,"</quote> 
	  <quote source="#flame-heart">"I have forgot what time the purple apples..."</quote>, or <quote source="#adolescence">"'neath the floating moon,"</quote> when he is capable of the stark sincerity of <title level="a">Harlem Shadows</title> or <title level="a">Spring in New Hampshire,</title>
	  or the poignancy of <ref target="#the-barrier"><title level="a">The Barrier</title></ref>.</p>
	  
	  <p>If Mr. McKay and the other poets don't stir us unusually 
	  when they travel over poetic roads so many others have 
	  <choice><sic>travelled</sic><corr>traveled</corr></choice> before them, they make us sit up and take notice 
	  when they write about their race and ours. They strike 
	  hard, and pierce deep. It is not a merely emotion 
	  that they express, but something fierce, and constant, and 
	  icy cold, and white hot. We believe Mr. Johnson 
	  when he says that <quote>"the Negro in the United States is consuming 
	  all of his energy in this <choice><sic>gruelling</sic><corr>grueling</corr></choice> race struggle."</quote> 
	  For it is the common thread running all through the book. 
	  It ranges from the restraint of Mr. Corrothers: <quote>"To be 
	  a Negro in a day like this demands rare patience—patience 
	  that can wait in utter darkness"</quote>; through Mr. Johnson's 
	  own bitter lines:

	  <quote>
	    <lg>
	      <l>Lessons in degradation, taught and learned,</l>
	      <l>The memories of cruel sights and deeds,</l>
	      <l>The pent-up bitterness, the unspent hate,</l>
	      <l>Filtered through fifteen generations. . . .</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>
	  
	  to Mr. McKay's bitterness (in <title level="a">To the White Fiends</title>), 
	  when he writes

	  <quote>
	    <lg>
	      <l>Think you I could not arm me with a gun</l>
	      <l>And shoot down ten of you for every one</l>
	      <l>Of my black brothers murdered, burnt by you?</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  is only speaking for thousands of his race who feel the 
	  same hatred—hatred which boils over once in a while, 
	  as we know, but breaks in ineffectual waves on the stony 
	  white shore, and turns to something like the bottomless 
	  despair, felt by Mr. Fenton Johnson:

	  <quote>
	    <lg>
	      <l>I am tired of work; I am tired of building up somebody else's civilization. . . .</l>
	      <l>Throw the children into the river; civilization has given us too many. It is better to die than it is to grow up and find out that your are colored.</l>

	  Brace, &amp; Company, New York. Price $1.75.</p>
	  <p>The poems in this book are characterized
	  by wide range of subject 
	  and a distinct gift for poetic
	  diction. The writer of them has a 
	  poet's soul. They have also the touch 
	  which marks them as the work of one 
	  of African descent.</p>
	  <p>Love of the tropics and its life
	  breathes through the lines of many: 
	  some refer wistfully to childhood
	  memories, as in contrast to the stern 
	  realities of the North, and the city. 
	  Old loves, old ties, old scenes have 
	  strong hold on the writer; the hard 
	  facts of life as it must be lived by 
	  a Negro in an Anglo-Saxon civilization 
	  press hard on his sensitive soul. 
	  His eyes are open to all its artistic 
	  possibilities, however, and he voices 
	  truthfully what he sees. Nature 
	  has given to Mr. McKay the gift of 
	  a singer, so that whatever mode or 
	  rhythm he adopts, it is satisfying 
	  and melodious. No free verse is 
	  here, although classic rules are 
	  treated freely, and he knows instinctively 
	  how to use words in a way that 
	  shows both culture and melody.</p>
	  <p>These poems seem to the writer 
	  marred by two faults, however, not 
	  of vision or of expression, but of 
	  the poet's mentality. Mr. McKay 
	  thinks, it appears, in terms both
	  negative and garish. His subjects 
	  are of things past, things longed for,
	  things absent, or things tragic. The 
	  positive, inspirational note, which 
	  we associate with poetry at its best,
	  is conspicuous by its absence, so that
	  one seems to be hearing too much 
	  music in the minor key. When he 
	  does touch a more positive note, he
	  becomes lurid, not in word but in 
	  thought, touching his subject in 
	  strong, glaring colors; his work at 
	  such times lacks taste. His mind 
	  seems to be a dark place lit up by 
	  fitful rays of passion, not a clear, 
	  bright place where one loves to linger.
	  <pb n="442" /> The book is well named 
	  "Harlem Shadows." In Claude McKay 
	  another minor poet has spoken.</p>

	  <p>James Weldon Johnson, in the sound 
	  and aggressive <ref target="#supp_johnson_american-book_preface">foreword to his collection, "The
	  Book of American Negro Poetry,"</ref> says that the 
	  negro is the creator of the only things artistic that 
	  have yet sprung from American soil and been universally 
	  acknowledged as distinctive American products. 
	  The four exhibits that he cites are the Uncle Remus 
	  folk talks, the spirituals or slave songs, the cakewalk 
	  and negro dancing, and ragtime. Let him grant to 
	  the Caucasian Walt Whitman's polyrhythms, and to 
	  the Amerind basket weaving and blanket designs, and 
	  the list is complete. In all fields artistic the negro is 
	  leaving a proud mark, the present volume being one 
	  of the best of his contributions to the awkward poetry 
	  of <choice><orig>to-day</orig><reg>today</reg></choice>.</p>

	  <p>Claude McKay was born in the island of Jamaica, 
	  in 1890. Before he was twenty-two he had composed 
	  many songs in the haunting dialect of the islanders; 
	  he is said to have been the first poet to have written 
	  in this dialect. In 1912 the medal of the Institute 
	  of Arts and Sciences was awarded him, in recognition 
	  of his <choice><orig>preëminence</orig><reg>preeminence</reg></choice>; he was the first negro to be 
	  awarded the medal. That same year he came to the 
	  United States, and since then has earned his living in 
	  all the jumbled ways that working-class negroes of 
	  the North turn to. But his main goals were life 
	  and song, and to these he has paid his chief allegiance. 
	  He is one of the editors of <title level='j'>The Liberator</title>, and is yet 
	  young in his singing.</p>

	  <p>Mr. McKay is highly effective as a propagandist. 
	  Upon those racial themes which demand so clarion a 
	  voice and so impelling a music he is not lacking:

	  <quote source="#enslaved">

	      <l>The whit man's world of wonders utterly:</l>
	      <l>Let it be swallowed up in earth's vast womb,</l>
	      <l>Or upward roll as sacrificial smoke,</l>
	      <l>To liberate my people from its yoke!</l>
	    </lg>

	  "The Lynching" has power and majesty, from its 
	  momentous opening to the sardonic throb at the end—

	  <quote source="#the-lynching">
	    <lg>
	      <l>And little lads, lynchers that were to be,</l>
	      <l>Danced round the dreadful thing in fiendish glee.</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  <ref target="#if-we-must-die">"If We Must Die"</ref> is a powerful call to battle; this 
	  trinity of sonnets is one of the most effective things 
	  ever done upon the theme. It compares favorably with 
	  Du Bois's "Litany," with James Weldon Johnson's 
	  "Brothers"; it is superior to William Ellery Leonard's 
	  "The Lynching Bee."</p>

	  <p>As stark realist, such poems as <ref target="#on-the-road">"On the Road,"</ref> a 
	  reminiscence of his dining car days, and the title poem 
	  and <ref target="#the-harlem-dancer">"The Harlem Dancer"</ref> for another phase of life, 
	  are vivid and gripping. Nor is he too close to the 
	  writhing to achieve the poet's penetrating detachment, 
	  as evidence in a line like this from "In Bondage":

	  <quote source="#in-bondage">
	    <lg>
	      <l>O black men, simple slaves of ruthless slaves.</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  He is both doer and seer in "America":
	  
	  <quote source="#america">
	    <lg>
	      <l>Although she . . . </l>
	      <l> . . . sinks into my throat her tiger's tooth . . .</l>
	      <l>I love this cultured hell that tests my youth!</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  His tributes to his mother, especially the one with the 
	  line <quote source="#heritage">"The best of me is the but the least of you,"</quote> are finely 
	  thought, and wrought as well. If he sometimes strays 
	  into an experiment as weak as

	  <quote source="#when-dawn-comes-to-the-city">
	    <lg>
	      <l>And the tethered cow is lowing, lowing, lowing,</l>

	      <l>And the shaggy Nannie goat is calling, calling, calling,</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  this is forgiven for the loveliness of his love songs, 
	  <ref target="#romance">"Romance,"</ref> "Flower of June," <ref target="#the-snow-fairy">"The Snow Fairy,"</ref> 
	  <ref target="#a-memory-of-june">"A Memory of June,"</ref> and especially the bird-like

	  <p>Mr. McKay is a lyric poet of strength and grace, 
	  with many varied keys to his playing. He is not an 
	  innovator in technique; Fenton Johnson and Anne 
	  Spencer, among negro poets, have gone much further 
	  in the newer modes of singing. But modernness is 
	  more than method. Mr. McKay's verse is free of 
	  the stilted pseudo-poetic vocabulary of the Amaranth-Asphodel 
	  poetlings, as of the inversions and verbal 
	  circumambulations of the What Time sonneteers and 
	  the Like As lyricists. His verse is modern in its 
	  directness and simplicity, its vigor and variety.</p>

	  <p>This sketch is not an attempt at authentic and prolonged 
	  criticism of Claude McKay's delightful "Harlem Shadows"—only 
	  a reaction, impulsive and personal.</p>

	  <p>Read "The Harlem Dancer":</p>

	  <quote source='#the-harlem-dancer'>
	    <lg type='poem'>
	      <l>"Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes</l>
	      <l>And watched her perfect, half-clothed body sway;</l>
	      <l>Her voice was like the sound of blended flutes</l>
	      <l>Blown by black players upon a picnic day.</l>
	      <l>She sang and danced on, gracefully and calm,</l>
	      <l>The light gauze hanging loose about her form;</l>
	      <l>To me she seemed a proudly-swaying palm</l>
	      <l>Grown lovelier for passing through a storm.</l>
	      <l>Upon her swarthy neck black shiny curls</l>
	      <l>Luxuriant fell; and tossing coins in praise,</l>
	      <l>The wine flushed, bold-eyed boys and even the girls,</l>
	      <l>Devoured her shape with eager passionate gaze;</l>
	      <l>But looking at her falsely-smiling face,</l>
	      <l>I knew her self was not in that strange place."</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  <p>Unfadingly canvassed are the lines: "To me she seemed a 
	  proudly swaying palm," etc., and, "her voice was like the 
	  sound of blended flutes," one can hear the magic tones. This 
	  picture of the lovely Harlem Dancer is as vividly painted 
	  on my mind as is the Mona Liza.</p>

	  <p>Vital and living is "Harlem Shadows":</p>

	  <quote source='#harlem-shadows'>
	    <lg>
	      <l>"I hear the halting footsteps of a lass</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall</l>
	      <l>Its veil. I see the shapes of girls who pass</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>To bend and barter at desires call.</l>
	      <l>Ah, little dark girls who in slippered feet</l>
	      <l rend='indent1'>Go prowling through the night from street to street!"</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  <pb n='717' />

	  <p>The flame-shod feet of "the little dark girls" pass over my 
	  heart and I feel that touch of anguish that was the author's 
	  own when he wrote these lines.</p>

	  <p>The prophecy in the last four lines of "America" is signfiicant:</p>

	  <quote source="#america">
	    <lg>
	      <l>"Darkly I gaze into the days ahead,</l>
	      <l>And see her might and granite wonders there,</l>
	      <l>Beneath the touch of Time's unerring hand</l>
	      <l>Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand."</l>
	    </lg>
	  </quote>

	  <p>It is the unmistakable writing on the wall, and yet what 
	  tender compassion pervades the author, who continues:</p>

	  <quote source="#america">
	    <lg>
	      <l>"I stand within her walls with not a shred</l>
	      <l>Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer."</l>

	  <note type="editorial"><p>When McKay published these two sonnets in <title level="j">Seven Arts</title>, he had already published collections of poetry under his own name in Jamaica. However, when he began publishing poems in the United States he used a pen name, a masculinization of his mother's name, Hannah Ann Elizabeth Edwards (see Cooper 26). McKay expains in his autobiography, "The nom de plume was adapted from my mother's name. I used it because at the time when the poems were submitted, I was a waiter at a women's club. The members were students of the arts. Some were literary aspirants and were always reading and discussing the new and little magazines. As I was a good enough waiter I did not care to be discovered as a poet there" (<title level='m'>Long Way from Home</title> 26).</p>
	  <p>The same issue of <title level="j">Seven Arts</title> featured material by J. D. Beresford, John Cournos, Clement Jones, Edna Kenton, Amy Lowell, Lajpat Rai, Paul Rosenfeld, Bertrand Russell, Jean Starr Untermeyer, and Willard Huntington.</p>

	  <p>I am a black man, born in Jamaica, <choice><abbr>B.W.I.</abbr><expan>British West Indies</expan></choice>, and 
	  have been living in America for the last six years. 
	  During my first year's residence in America I 
	  wrote the following group of poems. It was the first 
	  time I had ever come face to face with such manifest, 
	  implacable hate of my race, and my feelings were indescribable. 
	  I sent them so that you may see what my 
	  state of mind was at the time. I have written nothing 
	  similar to them since and don't think I ever shall 
	  again.</p>

	  <p>The whites at home constitute about 14 per cent. of 
	  the population only and they generally conform to the 
	  standard of English respectability. The few poor ones 
	  accept their fate resignedly and live at peace with the 
	  natives. The government is tolerant, somewhat benevolent, 
	  based on the principle of equal justice to all.
	  I had heard of prejudice in America but never dreamed 
	  of it being so intensely bitter; for at home there is also 
	  prejudice of the English sort, subtle and dignified, 
	  rooted in class distinction—color and race being hardly 
	  taken into account.</p>

	  <p>It was such an atmosphere I left for American to find 
	  here strong white men, splendid types, of better physique 
	  than any I had ever seen, exhibiting the most 
	  primitive animal hatred towards their weaker black 
	  brothers. In the South daily murders of a nature most 
	  hideous and revolting, in the North silent acquiescence, 
	  deep hate half-hidden under a puritan respectability, 
	  oft flaming up into an occasional lynching—this ugly 
	  raw sore in the body of a great nation. At first I was 
	  horrified, my spirit revolted against the ignoble cruelty 
	  and blindness of it all. Then I soon found myself 
	  hating in return; but this feeling couldn't last long 
	  for to hate is to be miserable.</p>

	  <p>Looking about me with bigger and clearer eyes I 
	  saw that this cruelty in different ways was going on 
	  all over the world. Whites were exploiting and oppressing 
	  whites even as they exploited and oppressed 
	  the yellows and blacks. And the oppressed, groaning 
	  under the lash, evinced the same despicable hate and 
	  harshness towards their weaker fellows. I ceased to 
	  think of people and things in the mass—why should 
	  I fight with mad dogs only to be bitten and probably 
	  transformed into a mad dog myself? I turned to the 
	  individual soul, the spiritual leaders, for comfort and 
	  consolation. I felt and still feel that one must seek 
	  for the noblest and best in the individual life only: 
	  each soul must save itself.</p>

	  <p>And now this great catastrophe has come upon the 
	  world proving the real hollowness of nationhood, patriotism, 
	  racial pride and most of the things which one 
	  was taught to respect and reverence.</p>

	  <p>There is very little to tell of my uneventful career. 
	  I was born in the heart of the little island of Jamaica 
	  on the 15th of September, 1889. My grandparents 
	  were slaves, my parents free-born. My mother was 
	  very sweet-natured, fond of books; my father, honest, 
	  stern even to harshness, hard working, beginning 
	  empty-handed he coaxed a good living from the soil, 
	  bought land, and grew to be a comparatively prosperous 
	  small settler. A firm believer in education, he tried to 
	  give all his eight children the best he could afford.</p>

	  <p>I was the last child and when I was nine years old 
	  my mother sent me to my eldest brother who was a 
	  schoolmaster in the northwestern part of the island.</p>

	  <p>From that time on I became interested in books. 
	  The school building, to which was attached the teacher's 
	  cottage, was an old slave house, plain, substantial 
	  and comfortable. My brother, an amateur journalist, 
	  country correspondent for the city papers, was fond 
	  of good books and possessed a nice library—all the 
	  great English masters and a few translations from the 
	  ancients. Not caring very much for play and having 
	  plenty of leisure I spent nearly all my time out of school 
	  reading. I read whatever pleased my fancy, secretly 
	  scribbling in prose and verse at the same time. Novels, 
	  history, bible literature, tales in verse like Scott's I 
	  read, and nearly all Shakespeare's plays for the absorbing 
	  story interest. As yet I couldn't perceive the 
	  truths. Now, looking back, I can see that that was 
	  the great formative period of my life—a time of perfect 
	  freedom to play, read and think as I liked.</p>

	  <p>I finished elementary school with my brother and 
	  helped him to teach while studying further under him. 
	  In 1906 I passed an examination for the Government 
	  Trade Scholarship and was apprenticed to a wheelwright 
	  and cabinet maker. But I couldn't learn a 
	  trade.</p>

	  <p>At this time I began writing verses of Jamaica <pb n="276" />
	  peasant life in the negro dialect. I met an Englishman 
	  who loved good books and their makes more than 
	  anything else. He opened up a new world to my view, 
	  introduced me to a greater, deeper literature—to 
	  Buddha, Schopenhauer and Goethe, Carlyle and 
	  Browning, Wilde, Carpenter, Whitman, Hugo, Verlaine, 
	  Baudelaire, Shaw and the different writers of 
	  the Rationalist Press—more than I had time to read, 
	  but nearly all my spare time I spent listening to his 
	  reading choice bits from them, discussing the greatness 
	  of their minds, and telling of their lives, which I must 
	  confess I sometimes found even more interesting than 
	  their works.</p>

	  <p>Trade proved a failure. I gave it up, joined the 
	  Jamaica Constabulary 1910-11, despised it and left. 
	  With Mr. Jekyll's help, the Englishman mentioned before, 
	  my <title level="m">Songs of Jamaica</title> was published at this time. 
	  I went home and farmed rather half-heartedly. The 
	  government was then encouraging the younger men to 
	  acquire a scientific agricultural education so that it 
	  could employ them to teach the peasantry modern ways 
	  of farming. I came to America in 1912 to study agriculture, 
	  went to Tuskegee, but not liking the semi-military, 
	  machinelike existence, I left for the 
	  Kansas State College where I stayed two years.</p>

	  <p>In the summer of 1914 I came to New York with a 
	  friend. We opened a little restaurant among our 
	  people which also proved a failure because I didn't put all 
	  my time and energy into it.</p>

	  <p>After a while I got married, but my wife wearied of 
	  the life in six months and went back to Jamaica. I 
	  hated to go back after having failed at nearly everything 
	  so I just stayed here and worked desultorily—porter, 
	  houseman, janitor, butler, waiter—anything 
	  that came handy. The life was different and fascinating 
	  and one can do menial work here and feel like a 
	  man sometimes, so I didn't mind it.</p>

	  <p>I am a waiter on the railroad now. Here are a few 
	  of my poems.</p>

	  <p>We have the good fortune to publish
	  month a page of sonnets and songs by a negro
	  poet practically unknown to the public, who seems to
	  have a greater and more simple and strong gift of
	  poetry than any other of his race has had. Claude
	  McKay is a native of Jamaica, who came to this country
	  seven years ago to study scientific agriculture.
	  He graduated from an agricultural college in the
	  west, but for reasons that I suppose are personal did
	  not return, as he had planned, to his own lazy island.
	  He stayed in America, living the active life of the
	  northern negroes, only with a more wandering will
	  and more song on his lips.</p>

	  <p>At the time when these poems were written he was
	  a waiter in a dining-car—a position from which he
	  was able to see a great many things and understand
	  them with a bold and unhesitating mind. His attitude
	  toward life is like Shelley's, free and yet strenuously
	  idealistic. I think his conscience is a little more
	  austere in matters of social conduct than in matter of
	  art. I wish he would write more poems as mettlesome
	  and perfectly chiselled throughout as some of
	  his stanzas are. And I think he will, for he is young
	  and he has arrived at the degree of power and skill
	  revealed in these poems practically without encouragement
	  or critical help. To me they show a fine
	  clear flame of life burning and not to be forgotten.</p>

	  <p>On the face of the facts, both as to the 
	  origin and the immediate (fighting) results 
	  of the Washington and Chicago race 
	  riots, the Negro certainly has nothing to be 
	  ashamed of and nothing to regret—save the 
	  casualties and sufferings which of necessity 
	  were the portion of both groups of 
	  participants. And he has many reasons for 
	  a justifiable pride in the prowess and resource 
	  displayed by the men and women 
	  of his race who were forced to take up arms 
	  in <choice><orig>defence</orig><reg>defense</reg></choice> of their lives and homes, and 
	  who, with their "backs to the wall," fighting 
	  over the Battle of Democracy, showed themselves 
	  the superiors in courage, resource 
	  and "civilized warfare" of their 
	  white opponents and, terribly outnumbered 
	  though they were, more than held their 
	  own, hitting back in hard, telling blows that 
	  had more effect in discouraging the murderous 
	  lust of white hoodlums and ruffians 
	  than any act on the part of the local and 
	  military authorities.</p>

	  <p>And in both cases the Negro had an undeniable 
	  "moral case." Both in Washington 
	  and in Chicago the white man plainly 
	  was the aggressor. And the aggressor on 
	  no excusable or condonable grounds! In 
	  Washington white marines and soldiers, 
	  travelling in groups, attacked and beat up 
	  lone colored men because of recent alleged 
	  attacks by Negroes on white women. In 
	  Chicago white bathers stoned to death a 
	  small colored boy whose drifting raft had 
	  carried him across the "white section" of 
	  the lake front!</p>

	  <p>But while both riots were caused by 
	  white aggression and while both have many 
	  features in common there are certain 
	  shameful things that occurred in Washington 
	  that, happily, were not duplicated in 
	  Chicago. For this reason, then, the two 
	  riots should be considered separately.</p>
	  
	  <div>
	    <head>The Washington Riot</head>

	    <p>Without a doubt the Washington trouble 
	    could have been averted had the Capital 
	    police taken prompt measures in suppression 
	    of the mob spirit of the white marines
	    and soldiers. And quite probably, too, the 
	    Chicago trouble would not have occurred 
	    so soon, though observers seem to agree 
	    that it was fated to come. But the Washington 
	    police took no steps to suppress the 
	    disorderly conduct of the white mobs during 
	    the days when they were beating up 
	    Negroes and "shooting up" the Negro sections 
	    with the colored people quiescent, 
	    long-suffering and patiently waiting for 
	    action on the part of the police to suppress 
	    the disorder and re-establish the reign of 
	    Law and Order. The white papers themselves 
	    report that:</p>

	    <quote>During the troubles on the first 
	    two nights the police made no effort 
	    to stop the White mobs. They 
	    seemed to consider it was none of 
	    their business...</quote>

	    <p>General attacks on Negroes began on 
	    July 19 and for two full days the white 
	    mobs had a merry, unopposed blood-picnic 
	    while the white Washington police stood 
	    by in the role of benevolent neutrals and 
	    the colored police were detached from duty
	    because, as The Globe reported:</p>

	    <quote>The attacks by service men on 
	    Negroes were so general that 
	    uniformed Negro policemen were detached 
	    from duty and sent home 
	    by the authorities.</quote>

	    <p>What a confession of weakness and race 
	    prejudice in high places! Thus the Negro 
	    population of Washington, refused the protection 
	    of white policemen and denied that 
	    of their own policemen, were thrown upon 
	    their own resources for the protection of 
	    their lives and homes. And how nobly and 
	    effectively they responded to this necessity 
	    is now a matter of proud record. Again we 
	    quote the white press:</p>

	    <quote>While in the minor disorders of 
	    Saturday and Monday night
	    crowds of white men assumed the 
	    aggressive, the latest rioting was 
	    marked by a general preparedness 
	    on the part of colored men, who 
	    <pb n="4" /> during the day purchased hundreds 
	    of revolvers. They formed 
	    into crowds in their own sections 
	    and attacked white men wherever
	    found.</quote>

	    <p>But with action on the part of the Negro
	    to defend his home and life against the 
	    wanton attacks of white mobs, the situation 
	    underwent a rapid change. The white 
	    police threw off its neutrality and we read 
	    such headlines in the Metropolitan dailies 
	    as:</p>

	    <quote>Capital Police and Negroes in Many 
	    Battles; Three Are Dead.</quote>

	    <p>And then, with the situation beyond control 
	    of the local police, came military intervention 
	    and the despatch of white soldiers 
	    to Washington by order of the Secretary 
	    of War, who took action after a conference 
	    with the President, and the appearance in 
	    the Metropolitan dailies of such headlines 
	    as:</p>

	    <quote>5 Dead in Capital Race Riots; U. S. 
	    Cavalry Fail to Stop Negroes.</quote>
	    
	    <p>Thus establishing the fact that, while 
	    in Washington riotous outbreaks had occurred 
	    between two groups of American 
	    citizens, it was only against the mobs of 
	    one group that the United States troops 
	    were used.</p>

	    <p>But even the United States regulars
	    seemed to have been unable to stop the 
	    long-suffering worm that at last had turned 
	    upon its persecutors; and Negroes, at first 
	    quiescent, later on the defensive, were now 
	    on the aggressive in true "Hell Fighters"<note type='editorial'>The 369th Infantry Regiment, better known as the "Harlem hellfighters," was a famous regiment of African-American, and African Puerto Rican, soldiers.</note> 
	    style, and were carrying the war into "the 
	    enemy's country," speeding through the 
	    streets of the white quarters in improvised 
	    tanks and leaving deadly leaden souvenirs 
	    behind:</p>

	    <quote>
	      <p>Numbers of Negroes took possession 
	      of high-powered automobiles in which they 
	      raced through the streets, pumping bullets 
	      from automatic weapons at all whites who 
	      happened without range. It is believed that 
	      numerous casualties resulting from this 
	      indiscriminate firing have not been reported 
	      to the police.</p>

	      <p>Pennsylvania Avenue, the main thoroughfare, 
	      was thronged all night with 
	      crowds of both whites and Negroes. 
	      Wherever they met there was a clash. 
	      Shots were exchanged and razors flashed. 
	      Negroes, defying the whites, are touring 
	      the Northwest section of the city and daring 
	      any white man or woman to leave their 
	      homes. Many shots have been fired at 
	      windows in which a white face was seen.</p>

	      <p>Apparently fearless of the shining 
	      bayonets of the United States forces, the 
	      Negroes organized a fleet of improvised 
	      tanks and started out to clean up the town. 
	      Practically all of them were armed. Many 
	      of the automobiles contained a surplus 
	      supply of sawed off shotguns loaded with 
	      heavy charges and buckshot.</p>
	    </quote>
	    
	    <p>And not only did the Negroes of the Capital 
	    fight back, and fight back with a vengeance, 
	    but the colored people in several 
	    near-by towns across the Maryland border 
	    organized and began to move upon the 
	    Capital to the aid of their brethren, and 
	    were only prevented from taking a hand 
	    in the Washington eruption by the quick 
	    action of the War Department which despatched 
	    a large force of the United States 
	    regulars to block their way to the Capital.</p>

	    <head>The Chicago Riot</head>
	    <p>Ill-feeling of long standing between the 
	    two races in Chicago was the underlying 
	    cause of the outbreak which, however, was 
	    undoubtedly precipitated by the Washington 
	    troubles. One of the chief reasons of 
	    <pb n="5" /> racial antagonism in Chicago was the rapid 
	    growth of the Negro population, its 
	    increasing competition in the labor market 
	    and its invasion of white neighborhoods.</p>

	    <p>The Chicago Negroes, having digested 
	    the lesson of the Washington riots when 
	    the white police stood by in benevolent neutrality 
	    to white mobs, fought back from the 
	    start. They, too, carried the war into "the 
	    enemy's territory," though in greater 
	    numerical inferiority than were the Washington 
	    Negroes. They, too, demonstrated that 
	    they had learnt a good many things by their 
	    participation in the White Man's War of 
	    1914-1919. One of their first acts being 
	    the storming and rifling of an armory and 
	    the cutting of the telephone wires in the 
	    "war area."</p>

	    <p>While, as said before, the two outbreaks 
	    were alike in their salient features, Chicago
	    was saved the disgraceful spectacle of the 
	    authorities truckling<note type='editorial'><hi rend='bold'>truckle</hi>, verb, to take a subordinate or inferior position; to be subservient, to submit; to yield meanly or obsequiously.</note> to the white mobs by 
	    detaching from duty her colored policemen. 
	    She escaped the stigma, too, of inciting to 
	    riot by her white press. Apart from this, 
	    however, the white mobs of Chicago have 
	    nothing to be proud of. Like the white 
	    mobs in Washington they were bravest in 
	    their attacks on lone Negroes, and in the 
	    instances when they cornered a lone and 
	    unarmed Negro they descended to barbarities 
	    that the Washington whites have not 
	    been, as yet, accused of. The New York 
	    Call of August first, reports, with photographs, 
	    one of the instances as follows:</p>

	    <quote>
	      <p>This mob has cornered a Negro under 
	      an outside stairway near 46th street and 
	      Wentworth avenue. The men who 'got' 
	      him are in the right of the picture just 
	      running to join the group about the stairway.</p>
	      
	      <p>And at the right is the dying Negro and 
	      the pair who were 'in at the death.' The 
	      arm of the one in the cap is still upraised. 
	      He has just thrown his last stone.</p>
	    </quote>

	    <p>Another lone Negro cornered in a white 
	    section was burned to death. And to such 
	    barbarities did the white mobs of Chicago 
	    descend that the Mayor of the second American 
	    city (to whom by the way all honor 
	    for his stand against turning the militia 
	    loose) gives as his reason for finally calling 
	    upon Governor Lowden for troops the fact 
	    that he was in receipt of authentic information 
	    that an attempt would be made to 
	    burn down the "Black Belt" with a duplication 
	    of the East St. Louis horrors:</p>

	    <quote>
	      <p>"Information was accurate, and I was 
	      satisfied it was well founded," the Mayor 
	      said. "The condition of the buildings was 
	      so dry that a conflagration might have 
	      started in no time. As evidence of the 
	      absolute authenticity of my information, I 
	      am having prepared a list of the fires and 
	      alarms last night."</p>
	    </quote>
	  </div>

	  <div>
	    <head>Comment</head>

	    <p>Naturally two race riots of such extent
	    excited considerable comment from the 
	    press and leading men of the nation. The 
	    New York Call and the New York World 
	    were outspoken in their denunciations of 
	    the white injustices which both recognized 
	    to be the underlying cause; the New York 
	    Globe joined in denouncing white injustice 
	    and the wanton attack upon Negro lives but 
	    nevertheless was of the opinion that Negroes 
	    never, never should resort to force; 
	    and Arthur Brisbane, in the New York 
	    American, while engaging in no denunciation 
	    that we have seen or heard of, proffered 
	    the advice that Negroes would do 
	    well not to resort to force as "The odds 
	    are too greater in number and in ability. 
	    Besides, real force resides in Government 
	    and this entire Government is white."

	    The only word from the white "Christian 
	    Church" was uttered by Cardinal Gibbons, 
	    who, not deigning to denounce the injustices 
	    to which the Negro is subjected, 
	    showed more interest in booze than in 
	    human lives and saw in the riots only proof
	    "that a legislative suppression of intoxicating 
	    drinks is not, as it was said to be, a 
	    panacea against all social and moral evils," 
	    which comment he supplemented with 
	    some drivel to the effect that capitalism was 
	    Labor's best friend.</p>

	    <p>Among such papers as The New York 
	    Times, the riots were attributed to the 
	    growth of Bolshevism among Negroes and 
	    not to any injustice in the white man's 
	    attitude and treatment of the Negro.</p>

	    <p>The ubiquitous Lusk Committee,<note type='editorial'>The New York State's Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate Seditious Activities, more commonly known as the "Lusk Committee" after its chair, New York State Senator Clayton R. Lusk, operated between 1919 and 1920. It investigated the activities of radical groups.</note> too, 
	    had its fling by the dissemination of the 
	    opinion of one Ven Svare, a Cleveland 
	    lawyer, whose testimony before the Stone 
	    Agers included the statement that:</p>

	    <quote>
	      <p>The Bolsheviki had a bad habit of 
	      getting hold of armored cars and running 
	      them through the streets of Petrograd and 
	      carrying on disorderly shooting, and when 
	      I read recently about he way some of the 
	      Negroes were behaving down at Washington 
	      it reminded me very much of the Bolshevist 
	      tactics of the same kind in Petrograd.</p>
	    </quote>
	    
	    <p>Not that Negroes who are determined to defend 
	    their lives and homes against
	    wanton and lawless attacks will have any 
	    objections to being called Bolshevists for so 
	    doing, but it is an interesting phase of a 
	    <pb n="6" /> serious situation and further proof of the 
	    hypocrisy and casuistry of the caucasian 
	    that he should feel called upon to frame 
	    up causes and excuses to explain two outbreaks 
	    that were acknowledgedly started 
	    by white mobs and in which colored men 
	    and women merely fought in defence of 
	    their lives and homes. Is the white man, 
	    already morally bankrupt, approaching 
	    intellectual bankruptcy?</p>

	  <p>America won the war that was alleged to be 
	  fought for the purpose of making the world safe 
	  for democracy, but in the light of recent happenings 
	  in Washington, the Capital city, and Chicago, 
	  it would seem as though the United States is not 
	  a part of the world. In order to win the war 
	  President Wilson employed "force, unstinted force" 
	  and those who expect to bring any similar desirable 
	  termination to a just cause can do no less than 
	  follow the splendid example set them by the reputed 
	  spokesman of humanity. That the lesson did 
	  not take long to penetrate the minds of Negroes is 
	  demonstrated by the change that has taken place 
	  in their demeanor and tactics. No longer are Negroes 
	  willing to be shot down or hunted from place 
	  to place like wild beasts; no longer will they flee 
	  from their homes and leave their property to the 
	  tender mercies of the howling and cowardly mob. 
	  They have changed, and now they intend to give 
	  men's account of themselves. If death is to be 
	  their portion, New Negroes are determined to make 
	  their dying a costly investment for all concerned. 
	  If they must die they are determined that they 
	  shall not travel through the valley of the shadow 
	  of death alone, but that some of their oppressors 
	  shall be their companions.</p>
	  
	  <p>This new spirit is but a reflex of the great war, 
	  and it is largely due to the insistent and vigorous 
	  agitation carried on by younger men of the race. 
	  The demand is uncompromisingly made for either 
	  liberty or death, and since death is likely to be a 
	  two-edged sword it will be to the advantage of 
	  those in a position to do so to give the race its 
	  long-denied liberty.</p>

	  <p>The new spirit animating Negroes is not confined 
	  to the United States, where it is most acutely 
	  manifested, but is simmering beneath the surface 
	  in every country where the race is oppressed. The 
	  Washington and Chicago outbreaks should be 
	  regarded as symptoms of a great pandemic, and the 
	  Negroes as courageous surgeons who performed the 
	  necessary though painful operation. That the remedy 
	  is efficacious is beyond question. It has 
	  brought results, for as a consequence the eyes of 
	  the entire world are focused upon the racial situation 
	  in the United States. The world knows now 
	  that the New Negroes are determined to observe 
	  the primal law of self-preservation whenever civil 
	  laws break down; to assist the authorities to preserve 
	  order and prevent themselves and families 
	  from being murdered in cold blood. Surely, no 
	  one can sincerely object to this new and laudable 
	  determination. Justification for this course is not 
	  lacking, for it is the white man's own Bible that 
	  says "Those who live by the sword shall perish by 
	  the sword," and since white men believe in force, 
	  Negroes who have mimicked them for nearly three 
	  centuries must copy them in this respect. Since 
	  fire must be fought with hell fire, and diamond 
	  alone can cut diamond, Negroes realize that force 
	  alone is an effective medium to counteract force. 
	  Counter irritants are useful in curing diseases, and 
	  Negroes are being driven by their white fellow 
	  citizens to investigate the curative values inherent 
	  in mass action, revolvers and other lethal devices 
	  when applied to social diseases.</p>

	  <p>The New Negro has arrived with stiffened back 
	  bone, dauntless manhood, defiant eye, steady hand 
	  and a will or iron. His creed is admirably summed 
	  up in the poem of Claude McKay, the black Jamaican 
	  poet, who is carving out for himself a niche in 
	  the Hall of Fame:</p>

	  <p>Though the poem is the production of a West Indian negro, a native 
	  of Jamaica, it nevertheless reflects the conviction of a large group of 
	  American citizens of African descent—a group who felt that death is 
	  preferable to a state halfway between slavery and freedom. This group 
	  has sworn by the blood of their kinsmen who fell on the battle fields 
	  of France, in a death grip with the foe, to help make the world safe 
	  for democracy, that they will no longer tamely submit to a denial 
	  of the rights guaranteed them by the National Constitution.</p>

	  <p>This does not mean that they intend to go around with a chip on 
	  the shoulder seeking for trouble; that they mean to be needlessly 
	  offensive; that they will provoke a conflict, or that they intend to 
	  resort to force to secure a fair measure of righteous justice. Not at 
	  all. It means that they will pursue the path of peace, imposing on 
	  themselves the virtue of self-restraint to the limit, impelled by the 
	  lofty purpose to agitate for a better understanding between the races. 
	  They will demand a hearing at the bar of public opinion.</p>

	  <p>It is quite certain, however, that the fulminating of the archaic 
	  and vicious dogma, "This is a white man's country," which of late 
	  has been resurrected, will not conduce to a better understanding between 
	  the races. Moreover, when Gen. Lee surrendered his sword to 
	  the commander of the triumphant armies of freedom at Appomattox, 
	  that dogma fell a shattered idol.</p>

	  <p>This year is the ter-centenary of the coming of our forebears to this 
	  country, which antedates by a year the coming of the Pilgrim Fathers. 
	  Our claim to an equitable ownership of this country is attested by 
	  three centuries of toil for its development and expansion, as well as 
	  by heroic deeds and sacrifices in its defense on fields of sanguinary 
	  conflict from Bunker Hill to Metz. We are here, and here to stay—not 
	  as aliens or pariahs but as a bona fide and integral part of the body 
	  politic. Our supreme desire is to be allowed to exercise our inalienable 
	  rights without let or hindrance, to prove a strong prop in the support 
	  of American institutions, and to continue a helpful factor in the development 
	  of American industry.</p>

	  <p>We most earnestly pray the Congress to make diligent inquiry as to 
	  the underlying cause of the race riots at Washington, D.C., Chicago, 
	  Ill., and Knoxville, Tenn., with the view of formulating such suggestions
	  for adoption by the people as, in your judgment, may prove a 
	  safeguard against similar outbreaks in the future, and also had lead to 
	  the establishment of a more friendly relationship between the races.</p>

	  <p>And you petitioners will ever pray.</p>

	  <p>The author of these poems is a native of Jamaica, where he was born in 1889, and where 
	  he lived till 1911, publishing a book of dialect verse already referred to in our columns. 
	  After reaching the United States he worked his way through Kansas to the West in various 
	  capacities, and gained experience which has not been without effect on the subject matter of his 
	  poetry. For a while he stayed at the Kansas Agricultural College, where the opportunity 
	  presented itself of studying 'literary English.' The fact that this is for Mr. McKay partly an 
	  acquired language adds considerably to the interest of his work. Here can be found some of those 
	  peculiar qualities which rendered the visit of the Southern Syncopated Orchestra so memorable 
	  last autumn, and for which we are becoming accustomed to look as the distinctive contribution 
	  of African Art in general.</p>

	  <p>The writer of these verses was born in the Clarendon 
	  Hills of Jamaica in 1889. In 1911 he published a small 
	  volume in the Negro dialect, and later left for the United 
	  States where he worked in various occupations and took 
	  courses in Agriculture and English at the Kansas State 
	  College. In the spring of this year he visited England to 
	  arrange for the publication of his poems.</p>

	  <p>Claude McKay is a pure blooded Negro<note type="editorial">McKay was born in Jamaica.</note>, and though 
	  we have recently been made aware of some of the more 
	  remarkable achievements of African Art typified by the 
	  sculpture from Benin, and in music by the 'Spirituals,' 
	  this is the first instance of success in poetry with which 
	  we in Europe at any rate have been brought into contact. 
	  The reasons for this late development are not far to seek, 
	  and the difficulties presented by modern literary English 
	  as an acquired medium would be sufficient to account for 
	  the lacuna; but the poems here selected may, in the 
	  opinion of not a few who have seen them in periodical 
	  form, claim a place beside the best work that the present 
	  generation is producing in this country.</p>

	      <p>James Weldon Johnson's <title level="m">The Book of American Negro Poetry</title> was published nearly contemporaneously with McKay's <title level="m">Harlem Shadows</title>, and its prefatory essay provides a valuable context for the initial reception of McKay's poetry.</p>

	  <pb n="xliii" />
	  <p>But the group of the new Negro poets, whose work 
	  makes up the bulk of this anthology, contains names 
	  destined to be known. Claude McKay, although still 
	  quite a young man, has already demonstrated his power, 
	  breadth and skill as a poet. Mr. McKay's breadth 
	  is as essential a part of his equipment as his power and
	  skill as a poet. He demonstrates a mastery of the three when as a 
	  Negro poet he pours out the bitterness and rebellion in 
	  his heart in those two sonnet-tragedies, <ref target="#if-we-must-die">"If We Must 
	  Die"</ref> and <ref target="#supp_mckay_to-the-white-fiends">"To the White Fiends,"</ref> in a manner that 
	  strikes terror; and when as a cosmic poet he creates the 
	  atmosphere and mood of poetic beauty in the absolute, 
	  as he does in <ref target="#spring-in-new-hampshire">"Spring in New Hampshire"</ref> and <ref target="#the-harlem-dancer">"The 
	  Harlem Dancer."</ref> Mr. McKay gives evidence that he 
	  has passed beyond the danger which threatens many of 
	  the new Negro poets—the danger of allowing the purely 
	  polemical phases of the race problem to choke their sense 
	  of artistry.</p>
	  <p>Mr. McKay's earliest work is unknown in this country. 
	  It consists of poems written and published in his 
	  native Jamaica. I was fortunate enough to run across 
	  this first volume, and I could not refrain from reproducing 
	  here one of the poems written in the West 
	  Indian Negro dialect. I have done this not only to 
	  illustrate the widest range of the poet's talent and to <pb n="xliv" />
	  offer a comparison between the American and the West 
	  Indian dialects, but on account of the intrinsic worth 
	  of the poem itself. I was much tempted to introduce 
	  several more, in spite of the fact that they might require 
	  a glossary, because however greater work Mr. McKay 
	  may do he can never do anything more touching and 
	  charming than these poems in the Jamaica dialect.</p>

	  </note>

	  <p>An English subject, being born and growing to 
	  manhood in Jamaica, Claude McKay, a pure blood Negro, was first discovered 
	  as a poet by English critics. In
	  Jamaica, as early as 
	  1911, when he was but 
	  twenty-two years of 
	  age, his <title level='m'>Constab Ballads</title>, 
	  in Negro dialect, 
	  was published. Even 
	  in so broken a tongue
	  this book revealed 
	  a poet—on the constabulary 
	  force of Jamaica. In 1920 his 
	  first book of poems in 
	  literary English, 
	  <title level='m'>Spring in New Hampshire</title>, 
	  came out in England with a <ref target='#supp_richards_spring-preface'><title level='a'>Preface</title> by 
	  Mr. I. A. Richards</ref>, of Cambridge, England. <pb n='127' />
	  Meanwhile, shortly after the publication of his 
	  first book, he had come to the United States.</p>

	  <p>Here he has worked at various occupations, has 
	  taken courses in Agriculture and English in the Kansas State College, and has thus become acquainted with life in the States. He is now on 
	  the editorial staff of the <title level='j'>Liberator</title>, New York.
	  There has been no poet of his race who has more 
	  poignantly felt and more artistically expressed 
	  the life of the American Negro. His poetry is a 
	  most noteworthy contribution to literature. From 
	  <title level='m'>Spring in New Hampshire</title> I am privileged to take 
	  a number of poems which will follow without 
	  comment:</p>

	      <l>For life is greater than the thousand wars</l>
	      <l>Men wage for it in their insatiate lust,</l>
	      <l>And will remain like the eternal stars</l>
	      <l>When all that is to-day is ashes and dust;</l>
	      <l>But I am bound with you in your mean graves,</l>

	  <p>Distinction of idea and phrase inheres in these 
	  poems. In them the Negro is esthetically conceived, 
	  and interpreted with vision. This is art 
	  working as it should. Mr. McKay has passion 
	  and the control of it to the ends of art. He has 
	  the poet's insight, the poet's understanding.</p>

	  <p>Perhaps the most arresting poem in this list, 
	  and the one most surely attesting the genius of the 
	  writer, is <title level='a'><hi rend='italics'>The Harlem Dancer</hi></title>. It is an achievement
	  in portrayal sufficient by itself to establish 
	  poetic reputation. The divination that penetrates 
	  to the secret purity of soul, or nobleness 
	  of character, through denying appearances—how 
	  rare is the faculty, and how necessary! Elsewhere 
	  I give a poem from a Negro woman which <pb n='130' />
	  evinces the same divine gift in the author, exhibited 
	  in a poem no less original and no less deeply 
	  impressive—Mrs. Spencer's <title level='a'><hi rend='italics'>At the Carnival</hi></title>.<note type='editorial'>Spencer's "At the Carnival," from page 158-159.

	    <head>AT THE CARNIVAL</head>

	    <l>Gay little Girl-of-the-Diving-Tank,</l>
	    <l>I desire a name for you,</l>
	    <l>Nice, as a right glove fits;</l>
	    <l>For you—who amid the malodorous</l>
	    <l>Mechanics of this unlovely thing,</l>
	    <l>Are darling of spirit and form.</l>
	    <l>I know you—a glance, and what you are</l>
	    <l>Sits-by-the-fire in my heart.</l>
	    <l>My Limousine-Lady knows you, or</l>
	    <l>Why does the slant-envy of her eye mark</l>
	    <l>Your straight <choice><sic>air</sic><corr cert='low'>hair</corr></choice> and radiant inclusive smile?</l>
	    <l>Guilt pins a fig-leaf; Innocence is its own adorning.</l>
	    <l>The bull-necked man knows you—this first time</l>
	    <l>His itching flesh sees form divine and vibrant health,</l>
	    <l>And thinks not of his avocation.</l>
	    <l>I came incuriously—</l> <pb n='159' />
	    <l>Set on no diversion save that my mind</l>
	    <l>Might safely nurse its brood of misdeeds</l>
	    <l>In the presence of a blind crowd.</l>
	    <l>The color of life was gray.</l>
	    <l>Everywhere the setting seemed right</l>
	    <l>For my mood!</l>
	    <l>Here the sausage and garlic booth</l>
	    <l>Sent unholy incense skyward;</l>
	    <l>There a quivering female-thing</l>
	    <l>Gestured assignations, and lied</l>
	    <l>To call it dancing;</l>
	    <l>There, too, were games of chance</l>
	    <l>With chances for none;</l>
	    <l>But oh! Girl-of-the-Tank, at last!</l>
	    <l>Gleaming Girl, how intimately pure and free</l>
	    <l>The gaze you send the crowd,</l>
	    <l>As though you know the dearth of beauty</l>
	    <l>In its sordid life.</l>
	    <l>We need you—my Limousine Lady,</l>
	    <l>The bull-necked man, and I.</l>
	    <l>Seeing you here brave and water-clean,</l>
	    <l>Leaven for the heavy ones of earth,</l>
	    <l>I am swift to feel that what makes</l>
	    <l>The plodder glad is good; and</l>
	    <l>Whatever is good is God.</l>
	    <l>The wonder is that you are here;</l>
	    <l>I have seen the queer in queer places,</l>
	    <l>But never before a heaven-fed</l>
	    <l>Naiad of the Carnival-Tank!</l>
	    <l>Little Diver, Destiny for you,</l>
	    <l>Like as for me, is shod in silence;</l>
	    <l>Years may seep into your soul</l>
	    <l>The bacilli of the usual and the expedient;</l>
	    <l>I implore Neptune to claim his child to-day!</l>

	  <p>The Negro's deep resentment of his wrongs has 
	  found its most artistic expression in the verse of 
	  a poet who came to use from Jamaica—Mr. Claude 
	  McKay. In <ref target="#supp_kerlin_negro-poets-and-their-poems">another chapter</ref> I have given the 
	  reader an opportunity to judge his merits. He <pb n='273' />
	  will be represented here by a sonnet, written, I 
	  believe, shortly after the race-riot in the national 
	  capital, July, 1919. It has been widely reprinted 
	  in the Negro newspapers,</p>

	  <p>Race consciousness has recently attained an 
	  extraordinary pitch in the Negro, and there seems 
	  to be no prospect of any abatement. The verse-smiths 
	  one and all have borne witness to a feeling 
	  of great intensity on all subjects pertaining to 
	  their race—the discriminations and injustices 
	  practised against it, the limitations that would be 
	  imposed upon it, the contumelies that would offend 
	  it. Ardent appeals are therefore made to race 
	  pride and ardent exhortations to race unity. The <pb n='274' />
	  ancient rôle of the poet whereby he is identified 
	  with the prophet is being resumed by the enkindled 
	  souls of black men. With their natural gift 
	  for music and eloquence, with their increasing 
	  culture, with their building up of poetic tradition 
	  now in process, with this intensification of race 
	  consciousness, almost anything may be expected 
	  of the Negro in another generation.</p>

	  <p>The following poems taken from Claude McKay's Harlem Shadows, reflect 
	  the spirit of resentment and militancy which characterizes the new negro in 
	  America. McKay, a native of Jamaica, came to the United States in 1912, 
	  where he pursued a checkered career. He was a student at Kansas State 
	  University of two years, but his restless spirit drove him int othe field of 
	  journalism. He was at one time associated with the Liberator and the 
	  Masses, before visiting the Soviet Union in 1921. Since then McKay has 
	  resided in Europe.</p>
