# Project Description

This repository contains material related to the development of a digital edition of Claude McKay's 1922 collection of poems *Harlem Shadows*. The goal is to create a reliable, annotated text based on page images freely available. The text will be created in TEI from which, I hope, we will generate ePub, HTML, and PDF versions of the text.

In addition to the encoded text file itself, this repository will also include XSLT stylesheets and other relevant material as they are developed.

**Note: In its current state this encoding is preliminary and not final.**
